       "\"Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day uh but but if you want to sort of see like a vision of the future it's like basically the the like the top 20 and even the top 100 is like totally dominated by China it's yeah this is like China and a little bit of Korea and Taiwan so you in are you in the top 20 in the world or top 20 wow in DIA yeah yeah do you want to tell everybody your handle no no don't tell them don't tell them it's not worth it well they they actually listed me with my actual name in the in the list oh did they really oh interesting um but um yeah there's only there's only two Americans in the top 20 uh the the rest almost everyone is from Asia otherwise we were talking about something that I think is a really good because people always think that video games are frivolous but what what you were saying I think that's really important is it it's so difficult that it requires you to only think about that and it can like relieve stress it can take out the rest of the world cuz it's so hard yeah you can only think about that yeah I mean if finally if I play a video game on Extreme difficulty then um I have to concentrate fully on the game um and it's it's has a calming effect yeah uh it sort of chills down um and uh I mean you mentioned I think many people like if you play martial arts or you play pool like something that that forces you it's like I think any anything that forces you to concentrate fully um actually has a has a calming effect I find it just sort of like um kind of a mental a restoring effect mentally it's like it's good Jiu-Jitsu is like that archeries like that as well like when you're shooting a bow you have to is there's so many moving things and you're trying you have to think only of it and it cleans the mind it cleans the mind yeah exactly I was watch I was reading this study about surgeons where they found that surgeons who regularly play video games make less errors well it's I mean video games require manual dexterity so uh it makes sense completely makes sense actually if somebody was like epic at video games uh i' I'd say like their surgical skill is going to be very good because in order to be good at video games any kind of fast reaction video games look at this 32% fewer errors 24% faster and scored 26% better overall than their non-player colleagues oh I believe that for sure that's incredible you should be required in medical school to play video games I if somebody's like top a top ranked video game player and they say they're a surgeon I'd be like plus plus one plus two type of thing oh top ranked for sure but this isn't even top ranked this is just people who play well your your manual dexterity has to be extremely high so you're you're looking at things on the screen you've got you're reacting and you some you got like 10 milliseconds to react yes um and um and and so if somebody's got uh incredible reaction times manual dexterity they're obviously going to be a good surgeon imagine if there was a course that you could take that course would promote you would be 26% better yeah everyone would have to take that course sure why would you want a surgeon that's less prepared you would say hey Bob did you take this course you didn't take this course don't you understand this course makes you 26% better sure you would have to take it everyone should have to play video games if you want to be a surgeon well I think it' be it certainly would be a very good test to see if somebody can't play video games well like that means I me because you got to move both hands simultaneously you got to react something very fast then um on the screen so and and if if your keystrokes or your mouse clicks or whatever are wrong uh then you lose the game so if somebody's like has a good rank in video games I would say that they're manual de necessarily their manual dexterity must be very extremely good well it's so hard motor skills have to be excellent if you think about like Starcraft or any any game like Quake any game where a lot of people are playing to rise to the top you have to be exceptional period as a human being there's to be something exceptional about you yeah actually Quake way way back in the day I was one of the world's best Quake players I know we talked about this yeah um I loved Quake yeah yeah I my final semester in college I probably put more time into Quake than all my college classes when I was on news radio all of the writers were super nerds they were very very fun guys and they had a land set up at the studio where they all played Quake I had never played video games and I would go in with the writers just kind of hang out with them we'd get silly and then we would would all start playing video games and playing Quake against each other and I got addicted like hardcore I got a T1 line installed in my house I went hardcore yeah exactly you're checking how many milliseconds of latency you oh yeah I was I was fully addicted I was making my own computers I was going to fries hardware and buying motherboards and putting everything together and you know it was too much of a Time suck though I'm an obsessive person I can't get involved like I can't put golf no it's too golf is too slow for I mean I know a lot of people find golf good and I mean I guess if you think of it like it's I guess if you're saying you're going to walk outdoors with friends and occasionally hit a ball then and and you're just as an outdoor walk then that's cool um and does require concentration we hitting the ball but it it's it's it's a it's this too slow for me nothing compares to video games in terms of like the amount of feedback you get like the the the the sensory overload you get when you're looking at a large high resolution screen you have a fast computer you have headphones on that you're hearing sounds from here and sounds behind you and Rockets are flying by you and it's there's nothing like that yeah but I think golf still is like Jamie will tell you Jam's an addict he's a Golf Nut it's super addictive and it takes like eight hours a day it's yes uh once you get into golf I think I guess any sport it gets super predictive um so but but for me the the int the intensity of video games is uh hard to beat yes it's and the people dismiss it because they think it's just a waste of time but we're showing like real world benefits so people playing video games yeah if you want to be a drone operator it's the only game in town yeah really good at video games yeah um for sure so um in fact I can actually tell U like what my me mental acuity is uh if I just play if I play a very hard video game so if I'm trying to sort of get like a an extremely good clear time in Diablo or something like that um or or any you know a post person shootter whatever the case may be like if I I can tell that I'm tired uh or my brain's not working as well as it should it's it's like a it's like a mental calibration you can tell immediately like what is what what how good is your mental state right right um and uh you know so it's like like if if you're trying to play really well like I If you play late at night and you're tired you would just play badly right and you can say okay you you may think that your brain is working well but it isn't because you can you play the video game and you're like you suck so okay yeah you're putting it under stress yeah you're really stress testing it you stress test it and uh cuz like sometimes like oh I think I think I'm fine but then you play the game like okay I'm not I might I'm like 10% below what I should be that's how I feel about workouts for sure like that's how I knew I had Co or I knew everyone in my family had Co and I trying to not get covid and so I was working out I was like something's up like I felt fine nor but then during exercise I was like okay I can tell there's something wrong here so let's back off relax yeah yeah it's like people who don't stress test their mind they think they're operating on the same level all the time like sometimes I come in here and I can't form a sense and I don't know what it is it's like what is going on so it's just like like sleep's not maybe like what sleep wasn't that good or something like that yeah something like that or I'm too busy and it's just it's not the words aren't coming out like I know how to talk I talk professionally and I can't talk it's like I mean sleep's is is is massive I mean like huge yeah so uh if I can tell me Le did I get a good night sleep or not if if I just play like uh video game for like five minutes I'm like okay my sleep wasn't that good um because my my you know and then sometimes they your brain will recover through the day and it's like okay like an hour or two after waking up it's better uh CU your brain does kind of recover from Bad nights sleep a little bit during you know what it really helps creatine apparently does it yeah creatine is actually a neut Tropic believe it or not there's a lot of like benefits of creatine that are really weird are there any downsides no no it's natural part of food yeah yeah especially women for for women apparently especially postmenopausal women it's very beneficial okay and uh it there's but there's a lot of like cognitive benefits and one of the big ones that they found recently is performance when sleep deprived mental performance when sleep deprived increases pretty measurably when you supplement with creatine is creatin naturally occurring in like steak or yeah it's like naturally occurring in meat I think I think that's where it's coming from I think it's a primarily an animal-based thing yeah but like I I did switch to like steak and eggs for breakfast and I found that's like a PowerUp oh yeah yeah yeah well we're all overrun with carbohydrates yeah yeah totally and you like carbohydrates make this big crash the rise and the Crash the rise and the Crash you stay flat if you eat like a a primarily High high protein high fat diet yeah your body runs off ketosis essentially I mean so I just have like steak and eggs no no bread or or anything and it's great actually it's a PowerUp I'd say people dismiss this whole carnivore diet thing because in our heads there's a lot of propagandist that put this thing out there that animal agriculture is the number one contributor to global warming this rubish not true it's hot  do matter not only is it hot  but the real problem is Factory f regenerative farming is carbon neutral if doesn't sequester carbon the the the animals are not going to make any difference to global warming like none Zer zero nothing do you think that that's just propaganda because of people that have a vested interest in like plant-based meat products and things along those lines green energy I think it's part of it um you know that you're generally going to get people pushing to avoid me like some people just you know um yeah maybe they got to financial interest maybe they just just like vegetarians or vegans or whatever um ideological ideological reasons um but uh it's not going to make any difference uh to global warming or you know the CO2 concentration atmosphere really um if if people eat fewer uh steaks it doesn't matter it's relevant irrelevant I want to be super clear about that yeah will not matter you will not even be able to measure it okay that's how irrelevant it is isn't it funny that that's unmeasurable heretic speaking like that's crazy talk now nowadays it's like you have to say that we have to eat less meat that meat is bad totally eat as much as you want it's not going to make a difference sing it sing it to world yeah absolutely um and if somebody says it does make a difference I'm like how will you measure it and if you can't even measure it then it's yeah yeah literally I won't be able to measure it well there's so much out today first of all all directions thank you so much for buying Twitter thank you so much I'm not exaggerating when I think you changed the course of history I really do I really think you you made a fork in the road we were headed down a path of censorship and of control of narratives that is unprecedented forget about what they were able to do back when they had newspapers and the media under control the what they were doing with social media by suppressing information and when you had a combined government effort like with the what they were doing with the laptop story y you have 51 Former Intelligence agents saying that this is Russ disinformation take it off offline and Twitter complied yeah if if you didn't buy that we wouldn't have known that we had no idea exactly uh no it's I mean the the reason I border was because I'm pretty attuned um since I I was like the most interacted with a user on Twitter before the acquisition so before the acquisition I had more interactions that than like there's some accounts like Obama and whatever had higher follower accounts uh but uh I had the most number of interactions of of any account in the system so um I was very attuned to like if if they saw change if they change the system I can tell immediately like and I'm like I'm like something weird is going on here you know like so there's like I I just got increasingly uneasy um and obviously when when they deplatform to sitting president you know not deep de deep platform Trump uh that was that was just insane um you know um and and and the things he was posting like he was posting things that that like he was posting good things he was saying like hey we don't do not Riot don't don't do any destruction of property you know please stay calm like that's the kind of stuff was posting yeah and you're like uh what's wrong with that that's and and then then then some people say like oh that's like some sort of dog whistle he means the opposite I'm like okay so we'll give you Trump's account now you you post what you think he should post because he can post nothing he can ask people to calm down like what it was insane like it didn't make any sense well it's completely a l local when you say it's dog whistling to tell his followers to not be violent that's crazy crazy that's crazy don't you think they'll listen to him yeah isn't that the whole point they listened to him and created violence in the first place that's what you think that's what you're you're accusing him of right and then there's the fact that we know that there was agents in the crowd that were agent provocators that were encouraging people to do illegal  we know that for a fact this is not that was always the big Alex Jones type 10 hat conspiracy theory cuz Alex proposed that back at the World Trade Organization protests I believe we in Seattle in the 90s and they sent in agent provocator started smashing things lighting things on fire now all a sudden a peaceful protest is no longer peaceful they move in the cops they shut everything down they had it set up where it was a no protest Zone where you couldn't even have a pin that had the WTO with a red line through it they wouldn't let you go in through to go to work so you couldn't prot you couldn't exercise your first amendment rights you couldn't even like have a peaceful protest a sticker on your car you couldn't have that it's crazy it is crazy so no I think we're we we're very much at a folk in the road in uh Destiny um and um you know so I I mean the reason I yeah did the Twitter acquisition was like it's like man if I don't do this I think we're screwed is the issue well you didn't do it no one else was going to do it because it wasn't a financial winner it was kind of a crazy move it's a crazy move I mean the the thing was way overpriced um and um you know like long term I think uh we can we can ultimately make it a win for investors but boy this is this is a this is a hard way to make a living well there's also a concerted effort to suppress it there's a concered effort with the advertisers well we we we had a and still have um a massive Advertiser boycott that was organized by a bunch of leftwing NGS like uh you know and and you always want and I should have I should have brought my uh I I have a hat make all well fiction again I've seen that hat yeah I I should have I was going toar I should have bought my make oil fiction had to um but but uh yeah I mean it's just totally totally nuts um so if you didn't do it no one would have and here's the hilarious narrative that I keep hearing from idiots uh elon's a bad business man Twitter is worth you know 400% less than when he bought it no it wasn't worth that in the first place it wasn't worth that in the first place it wasn't worth $44 billion you morons like wrong and also you're not taking into account The Advertiser boycott exact that's total yeah exactly so there are these organizations like you can tell there's like they're like like when they have an ellian name so like the like the C Center for countering digital hate is is a total scam organization you know CU they're like the ministry of truth type of thing in O um you know uh they like there censorship organization yeah um and they organiz and and they pushed uh the advertisers to boycott uh so we still have like some of the boycott is is is starting to lift um and I think if Trump wins we'll we'll see you know probably a lot most most of the boycott lift um but if if Kamala wins we'll see that boycott get stronger and and they'll they'll freaking shut down there's no way that that the sort of Kamala po regime would allow X to exist you really think that they'll be able to shut it down though is there Pathway to that uh yes what would they do um well I mean they can just they can sck the doj on you know and say like you know they've had this whole thing about like hate speech misinformation whatever except they're the ones pushing the misinformation but that doesn't stop them from filing massive you know lawsuits and using the doj I mean like the doj is you know been attacking SpaceX for example for not hiring Asylum Seekers even though it is legal for SpaceX to hire anyone who is not a permanent resident of the us so we we're downed if we do and downed if we don't there an examp just an example of what drj can do so it's illegal to hire someone who's not an American citizen um for what SpaceX uh is considered an an advanced weapons technology so it's it's covered by International traffic and arms regulations because we make rocket technology that can be used against the United States so like if North North Korea or Iran got SpaceX rocket technology they could use that to launch nukes at America America right that would be bad yeah that'd be really bad that would be really bad so so we're we're uh since we are in like the most extreme category of weapons technology at SpaceX um under us itar law it is uh illegal for us to hire anyone who's not a permanent resident because the presumption um is that if they're not a permanent resident they're going to return to their home country and take the rocket technology with them so that's and so so it's illegal for us to hire um anyone who's not a either has not a per they can they can be have a green card or be a citizen they just have to be a permanent resident of the United States um then there's another law that says if you if you discriminate against Asylum Seekers that's also you're also breaking the law so they they just so that the drj which the DJ drj can only do a small number of big lawsuits every year laun a giant lawsuit against SpaceX uh saying that SpaceX uh discriminated against Asylum Seekers and we're like but we're like but it's illegal for us to hire anyone who's not a permanent resident so we're in this like this is what I mean it's like or well the orell situation is getting insane like you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't so you're damned can you imagine history looking back f up man at when you watch the robot arms catch the rocket and you realize like this is like one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of Aerospace like it is one of the more wildest accomplishments when you watch that thing come and you see all the people cheering and it catches it perfectly like holy imagine how history is going to look back at the doj going after that company yeah how insane it is a big lawsuit with an army of lawyers like this was not like some minor thing but it doesn't even make any sense logically like how can it even get brought to court if it's illegal that's exactly so that's what I mean like like like basically if the government wants to go after you they'll just find a reason you it's like that famous quote um from barrier you know like so like Stalin's Like Chief torturer the head of St Stalin's secret police and he's like Chief torturer truly evil human being like this guy barrier uh he his one of his famous quotes was show me the man and I'll show you the crime right they just they just they they like they decide that you're the Target and then they figure out the crime afterwards that's the issue they decided SpaceX was a Target they just figured out the crime afterwards which is so crazy because that's exactly what they saying Trump is going to do if he gets into office they're doing all the things that they accuse Trump of doing yeah openly openly yeah I mean the the sheer number of hoaxes that the Democratic party is pushing over and over again they and and it's like look I understand like politicians are going to you know exaggerate they're going to misspeak and they'll tell occasional you know untruths whatever that's that's how it is in politics but when you have deliberate inerted repeated pushing of hoaxes you're like wait a second like come on man this is too this is too far and you're supposed to be the good guys you're supposed and you claim to be the good guys I'm like exactly you're supposed to be the progressives yes the dams are like oh we're the good guys we're the honest people no no hang on you can't claim to be the good guys you can't claim to be the honest people if you're deliberately post pushing hoaxes that have been debunked thoroughly yeah like even Snopes which is a liberal thing says it's bogus yeah like the fine people ho Obama just said that on stage just said that I was like what the flying he doesn't give a he doesn't give a they're just they're just FL goddamn lie flat out lie flat out lie how about the other one where kamala's campaign used what Trump was saying about protecting women and uh from illegal immigrants thank you you remember that that he what he was saying is the women like it or not I'm going to do it yeah when he was saying that they were trying to say that he was taking away women's right to choose whether women like it or not like that's not what he was saying absolutely he was literally talking about protecting them from dangerous people that are sneaking in through the Border yes exactly they'll take like like not even a full sentence like a half a sentence from Trump and then and then they'll push it on on every ad every you know every speaking event every and it gets repeated on the news this is what's crazy they'll talk about it on these new shows quote new shows yeah exactly I mean um I mean a recent one that that came up um which had a lot of people cuz you a lot of people reached out to me was like they're like oh Trump says he wants to execute Liz Cheney I'm like that is utter it's not what he said at all it's not what he said at all he all he said was like was like what he was saying is that look if if Liz Chene uh um actually had to fight at the front lines should think twice about going to war exactly that like it's easy to go it's easy to go to war it's easy to be a warmonger if you don't have to you know risk dying at the front lines like if other like basically it's up if if people are having like fancy dinners in Washington DC um while people are being slaughtered in trenches you know it's like you're not feeling the pain exactly you're not taking the risk it's someone else dying that's like that's that's cruel and lacking in empathy um and and all Trump was saying was that it's like Liz cheny would be much Liz cheny would be much less of a warmonger because she's a huge warmonger just like her dad um if uh she actually had had to go to the front lines and fight herself and meanwhile they're saying that he should he's saying she should be shot yes which is a total lie but I had like tons of people call me this weekend saying oh Trump says he's going to put Liz train in a firing squad I'm like that is an outrageous lie and the Legacy Media ran with that lie big time yeah it's crazy it's it's just wild to see and if it wasn't for Twitter or X now I don't think we would know about all this stuff I I think it would be very difficult for you I think YouTube throttled they did something weird they won't say what they did but they did something weird with the Trump interview that I did yeah where you couldn't find it it doesn't make sense like like made no sense I mean it's like the it was like the biggest interview on Earth yeah and you can't find it yeah not only that it wasn't trending it wasn't trending it wasn't trending it wasn't trending you're like like this just no excuse for that man no excuse there's no excuse it was getting a million views 1 Point what was it 1.4 an hour one point in time 1.5 an hour yeah and it wasn't trending yeah like and and it's like it's it's like your channel is a known channel it's not it's not like it was started yesterday it's like yeah it's like this is a high trust yours is a high trust channel it's like like you're not trying to sell scam crypto coins or something you know um so well thank God we put it on X as well because I think just with your account and my account alone it's like 70 million views yeah exactly yeah well it's like you can't hide things anymore because of you and if it wasn't for you I think they would have had total control of social media by now they would have th they they banned so many accounts during the pandemic so many dissenting scientists and doctors and Physicians they banned so many conspiracy theorists so many people that colored Outside the Lines they would have done that everywhere and it it probably would have P I think even at what's going on at Facebook they're they're being more lenient you know you hear Zuckerberg talking about taking a more libertarian stance that's entirely reaction to the way Twitter has kind of moved the watermark exactly so um as soon as as soon as any company steps out of line and is willing to actually have the truth debated on their platform it forces the other platforms to allow things to be more truthful to to not censor because their censorship becomes glaringly obvious yes um yes and you know the the the best thing I found for as a rebuttal like if somebody if there's a hoax is just go to the source material you know if if you think if somebody thinks uh you know oh you know Trump said that that we should put Liz Cheney in a firing squad I'm like let let me send you a link to X so you can watch his video that's the best way it's it's don't don't take my opinion for it don't take anyone's opinion for it go to the source material and Community notes yes and Community a community notes is the best it's awesome it's incredible because everybody gets checked yes including me yeah um and with Community notes the all the software is open source and all the data is open source so you can recreate any given note independently that's amazing yeah that's how it's total absolute transparency in every way um you know sometimes I get I get asked like oh y can you remove a note you know mostly by the left but sometimes by the right I'm like I'm like I don't even remove remove notes on my own account nothing and and and by the way everything is totally open so if I did that it would stick out like a sore thumb immediately like it's not going to be subtle is the best counter to misinformation yes absolutely like let everybody look at it and say okay here's what the actual facts say yes exactly the counter to misinformation is better information not just that but having it checked in real time by the community so you have millions of people that can go over it and debate whether or not this is true or that's true yes and and just and like I said the best way to understand the truth of things is don't take anyone's opinion for it look at the source material you know so it's like look at what someone actually said look at what someone actually did look at the real videos of the situation and and then you can actually you'll know what's real so as of today when you were literally on your way here you sent me this text saying that they're trying to lock you up in jail Pennsylvania tell me what the is happening well you know there's the classic sort of Soros da situation um so we we're making a lot of progress in Pennsylvania so uh you know I've been I've given a whole bunch of talks in throughout the the state because psylvia is the Lynch pen in this election you know whoever wins Pennsylvania wins the election so um so I've been giving to I spent three years in Pennsylvania I went to college in in Philadelphia so um so it's not like I'm not a total I'm not a total stranger to the state you know I spent three years there um and um and and we you know we we we we've organized this uh petition in support of the Constitution um which I think is a good thing um and and specifically asking people to uh and and and we wanted this to be like um registered voters in swing States like basically we want to send a message to the politicians to say that the people care about the Constitution because there have been all these attacks on the Constitution they've been especially on the Democrat side they've been repeatedly saying that that the that the first amendment is an obstacle because and they're claiming oh the first amendment is is is enabling dis disinformation misinformation and I'm like yo there's a reason for the first Amendment like freedom of speech the reason they the founders of the country put you know the freedom of speech there is because they came from countries where if you spoke your mind you would get shot or imprisoned that's why the First Amendment exists and the Second Amendment is there to stop the tney of government the Second Amendment the right to bear arms is there to protect freedom of speech um you know um you know and I've had these debates especially with people in LA because they're they're like want to take everyone's guns away and I'm like yo can you guarantee me that the government that we will never have a tyrannical government in the in the United States can you can you make that guarantee they're like well nobody can make that guarantee I'm like then we need to keep our guns because that's the that's what's going to stop it that sounds crazy for people to hear because they think about gun violence and gun problems and gun this and gun that but that's the reality of the world that we live in is that tyranny is possible and it exists other places and it's slowly existing it's slowly rearing its head in the UK you're you're seeing I I think the the number of people that have been arrested for just social media uh posts is bananas it's in the thousands yes several thousand people have been have been given prison sentences sentences in the UK for social media posts that where there was no explicit link to actual violence but they just said it encouraged violence like well did anyone actually do anything as a result of that media post well no but they they just and and then they have a prison overcrowding situation in the UK so they quite literally releasing convicted pedophiles and putting people in jail for Facebook posts that's an actual thing happening in Britain that is so wild like it's you're like so wild the  you know is going on and what's insane to me fiction again yeah you know but it's all being encouraged by the left kangi Brown Jackson John KY johnry was one of the people who said that he's on camera re like a few weeks ago saying that the first amendment is a pro is an obstacle to fighting misinformation yeah that's crazy that's such a crazy thing to say when you have a solution in community notes you have a solution in something like that that could clear everything up any confusion within a day or two and and even without a community note you can reply to a post and with with evidence that that that shows that the post is wrong you don't even need Community notes I mean Community notes is helpful because it sticks to the original note yes but in the replies you can say here's why you're wrong here are the reasons and here's the evidence the argument is that people are too unsophisticated that they're not going to research these things they're going to be a victim of misinformation so they're going to read something it's incorrect they're going to run with it people are going to die people are going to we're going to ruin the world because people believed in misinformation it's a stupid argument it's a stupid argument because it's an argument that they're too dumb to know what's right or wrong you if you know cuz you're saying it's misinformation why do you think that you're smarter than everybody who reads that exactly and obviously anyone on the X system uh knows that things are posted and then there are replies and there are bules and it's immediately corrected but where are the corrections for the Legacy Media right you know when when if um you know some broadcast media they they they they they said St say false things all the time but it's a one-way Street there's no rebuttal there's no counter right you know there who's apologized for being incorrect about what did Rachel mat ever apologize for telling everybody that if you get the covid vaccine you're never going to get Co it won't the virus stops with you never no one ever it's just it was not true at the time there was no evidence to support it at the time it's pure propaganda and she said it the Russia gate hoax the for three years they said that he was Putin's toy and that Putin had him compromised the steel dossier steel dosier was completely fabricated by a lawyer poins koi um uh who was paid by the Clinton campaign literally crazy and still people think the Russia hoax is real and there's no repercussions no one had to apologize Hillary could never came out and apologize for that and people still listen to her the whole thing is crazy and it's all coming from the left which growing up as a a person who was in the left my whole life it doesn't make any  sense same same I mean I I I I even I I I was on the left until like three years ago like I I mean you know it's not the left anymore it's not the left anymore it's just like I think we obviously want I mean I I I believe like we want freedom like like we want we want to maximize person personal Liberty uh I think we want we want to be kind to people you know we want to have empathy uh and um but but it's very important to have personal freedom and a merit based society on the left is is wants to oppress your freedoms especially freedom speech um and they want to they want to have a non-m marit based society you know with race based and sex based preferences and it's like well wait a second no we just want people to succeed based on their skills and their hard work and if they don't want people to express themselves about particular issues then they're not doing the will of the people and if they're trying to suppress people's ability to communicate they're only doing that because they want to do things that people don't want them to do and they want to silence opposition that's all it is and the fact that people can't see that they want to call Trump a fascist the whole thing is through the Looking Glass it's just I mean it's like one hoax after another that that they're perpetrating against Trump I me like they try to call the the rally at Madison Square Gardens Like A Nazi rally I'm like yo there was like literally an Israeli flag in the audience um I think like a quarter of the speakers were Jewish like there was like there were people of every race color creed religion at that at that rally like tell me what about that is Nazi no and yet it was portrayed as a Nazi rally MSNBC they they literally showed video of the Nazi Rally from 1930s and then compared it to the Trump rally now ignoring the fact that Jimmy Carter spoke there there have been dozens of political rallies at medicine Square Gardens dozens on the on the Democrat side like people and people on X like and here's exactly here's Jimmy Carter and here's Bill Clinton and here's wait a second actually it looks like uh every presidential candidate has done a uh on the Democrat side has done a rally at mass square gardens are they Nazis too but what they're doing is they're praying on lwi information voters who aren't engaged actively on social media who don't have the time to look through everything exactly yeah like people are living if people are just on looking at Legacy mainstream media then they have a totally different worldview than if they're on X uh and and seeing the the actual flow of argument yes and the actual evidence well what was the push back like what happened when you guys released the Twitter files cuz I think the Twitter files is probably one of the most important things in this age of information for understanding the influence that government has on social media and and on discourse because when when we found out that that was the case that the government was actually asking Twitter to remove posts that were factual did they did the same thing to Facebook they had them throttle pieces of one of Tucker Carlson's show they they suppress the views by 50% yeah of factual information yeah no there was there was massive government interference in Twitter um but but like Twitter welcomed it that's important to old Twitter welcomed it uh I mean TW old Twitter was controlled by by far-left activists yeah so uh and and uh they they welcomed the Govern interference the Govern they got paid by the government for it that's crazy they got paid for their time correct yeah they got paid millions of dollars for for suppressing information so it's like Bill and a bunch of it was like flat out illegal like the FBI had this like this this this sort of magic portal into the Twitter system uh and and but all of the communication in that sort in this portal was autod deleted after two weeks which breaks Federal Foy laws so we don't even know what was said because it was all deleted after two weeks that's insane yeah that's so crazy it's so crazy that people thought that was okay it's not super not okay no it's super not okay it's unconstitutional and no one would want that no one would want the government to have that kind of access exactly and what was the blowback like when all that stuff got released like you had to anticipate that there was going to be problems when you when you release that like what was what happened well we got a lot of we we did lose a lot of advertising dollars um and um which is crazy because it's essentially like one of the most important forms of Journalism is exposing government corruption yes I mean this is the weird weird thing it's like the left used to be uh big big on exposing government corruption but now but once they control the government they no longer want to EXP the government corruption right they want to pretend that the leftwing government's incapable of corruption cuz we're on the good side I I think it maybe just like you know whoever's in power kind of doesn't want the you know the other side hurt um because as you pointed out like the left historically up until I don't know maybe even 10 years ago or something like that um was the Free Speech party and now it's the anti-free speech party and they just they use they use words like like oh we have to be against hate speech and misinformation disinformation but these are propaganda words you know it's like uh well who's defining hate speech who's defining misinformation the government do you really trust the government to make that definition um the whole point of the of the first amendment is like you do not trust the government well especially when they're wrong and then there's no repercussions yeah like with the whole Lab leak theory if you get you would get kicked off of YouTube if you even presented this argument that hey maybe that Corona virus lab where they're doing work on the exact same virus that got released yep hey maybe that's where it came from since that's where the virus started what do you think guys yeah they kick you right off of YouTube yeah um yes exactly it's like do you think maybe the it could have come from the place called the novel Corona virus Research Institute that John Stewart bit that he did on coar was amazing what does it say on the door again uh can I see you a business card and to see coar like resisting it with every fiber of his what's going to happen to us he was totally blocking the bit to the point where John Stewart got off his chair and started walking around to try to take control yeah good on John and then the left tried to cancel John Stewart of course meanwhile he was right he right and no apologies no apologies yeah and you know the whole fouchy thing like any criticism of fouchy it's like an freaking demon if you ask me if you read rfk's book if the real Anthony fouchy if that's correct if the facts are in there that's true it's all referenced you could find the sources and on top of it he's never been sued for that book which doesn't make any sense if he just made a bunch of Lies up he would get sued yes so the guy's a monster I think so yeah I think so too yeah yeah yeah yeah I think like just looking at the lies that he told the way he tried to Define gain of function research to ran Paul but he I think a lot maybe a lot of people out there don't realize Fouch he funded the the the the bioweapons research that was going on in in Wuhan and he he Bank shotted off like he can't send the money directly to China he just bankshot it off Eco Health right this just like fake nonprofit in the US and they sent it to Wuhan and Obama put the skids on that he stopped that in 2014 yes I mean so you know um to to give Obama throw Obama give Obama some credit he actually was like looking at this and say hey this is crazy and uh we need and he so he he actually did uh stop the like like the so-called G gain of function again a propaganda word uh because what is the function they're talking about death right right so if if if you actually use the right word this is gain of function is death maximization right then you're like oh oh hey guys should refund uh uh bioweapon Research into death maximization cuz that's what gain of function means yeah it means the function making a disease so that people can get it give it to people and by the way what's that function again oh the function is death okay so just call it a death maximizing virus if you're doing research on that and the idea behind this research is so that we can cure these things how come you don't have a cure start with a start with a cure cure first disease second it doesn't make any sense like you guys had no strategy for dealing with it if it got out and so you have to like make up this this new vaccine in like record time operation warp speed released to the people with very little testing it's crazy it was crazy the whole thing's crazy and everybody just went along with it Looney Tunes Next Level well it's the scop was fascinating to watch people step in line that's like one of the biggest SS of all time of all time of all time and everybody got in line and when you take it back to when pharmaceutical drug companies were able to advertise on media in the 1990s that Chang one of two countries the whole that allows this and because of that because we don't have socialized medicine it's a complete profit scam and they went hard claiming all sorts of things that were never researched all sorts of things that not supported by data like the fact that it would stop transmission the fact that it would stop infection the fact that it was safe for pregnant women the fact that it was safe for children all of its yes and they pushed it on the whole world and if you didn't say that at a cocktail party you were a pariah yes and you were an antivaxer it was totally psycho it was like being a Holocaust in hour you get kicked out of polite Society exactly bananas and I should say like I'm actually generally Pro vaccine overall you know I think we should look at these things that but that but I believe in the scientific method so so you have a blanket except anything you have a blanket except that any any given medication or any given treatment is is is 100% good you should always be it with some skepticism especially when you're getting the data from pharmaceutical drug companies that have like a long history of criminal got a Ved interest conduct yes they've got a vested interest in the research it's sort of like asking tobacco companies about you know whether smoking it's dangerous you know exactly the same thing like God according to our scientists everything's fine yeah they lied in court forever the same thing they do with oxycoton when they said that it wasn't addictive like they have a long history of being full of if it makes them money and that's what they do that's their business they've literally lost multi-billion dollar lawsuits in this massive massive they're in the you have amazing scientists right you have these clinical researchers these people that developed these incredible drugs and they this is their job their job is to figure out some new way to cure something some new way to stop things and then you have the money people sure and the problem is when you have this one thing that you would assume they're only doing it to help people and then they have this other faction that they're all just numbers people and all they give a about is maximizing profits and making sure they literally have a an obligation to their shareholders they have to make the most amount of money possible and so they just want to push it on everybody regard like the vioc Scandal there's internal emails showing they knew there was going to be cardiovascular events people were going to get strokes and they're like I think we're still going to do well and they did they made like 12 billion dollars they got fined seven and 50 to 60,000 people died holy yeah one of them was a friend of mine got a stroke and died yeah no he didn't die he lived but he was a really healthy guy aned the same after yeah NE problems and he took Vio and all a sudden he was slurring his words and he couldn't concentrate and people like I think you're having a  stroke and they took him to the hospital and then then you have this giant class action lawsuit then Vio gets pulled from the market and they get sued and the whole thing's crazy but there's a long history of this I think what did what is the number like onethird of the drugs that the FDA approves gets pulled it's bananas that is crazy that's crazy you're shitty at onethird of the things that you say are okay but yet you're trying to stop MDMA therapy for veterans yeah they should let MDMA through honestly that think that actually help a lot of people it would help a lot of people help a lot of people there's a lot of different therapies specifically psilocybin iag the fact you have to go to Mexico to get ibaan therapy for veterans so many guys I've talked to have gone over there and it's like completely giving them a a clean slate refresh their mind and totally new perspective on life alleviated depression cured addictions illegal yeah illegal oxycotton go get it yeah um and I know some people who like their their life was ruined by oxyon you know oh yeah because uh I mean it it really depends on on you know somebody in individual biochemistry um like to me like like um opioids are not addictive to me like I you know I've had them when I've had operations or something and uh they they they're they barely affect the my pain level and they make me like itchy and uncomfortable they make me stupid exactly but but I'm like so so like like I could never get addicted to alcohol or or opioids it's just impossible like because my biochemistry just does not have like but I love tasty food feel like you know you know if if if there's I'm addicted to tasty food sure um but like there can be like I have a whole of of alcohol it's there for decoration I never done sh basically I feel the same way I could easily quit alcohol I mean I'll go weeks without having a drink and doesn't bother me at all but I know some people they have one drink and they're Off to the Races and that's the difference in the the biochemical differences that we all have yeah I mean I think that's the case with a lot of addictions I'm not addicted to gambling but I get it I see it I've seen it in people but I'm I'm I have this aversion to things that I know are going to ruin my life like i' I see it that's why I've never tried cocaine I just saw too many people it looks too fun like I don't want to get involved yeah I mean I mean I think generally for any given uh drug legal or illegal you could the question is can you complete the following sentence blank made me a better [Laughter] person like I've never heard anyone say meth made them a better person or cocaine made them a better person no ever um made a lot of soldiers better I think that's yeah I mean if you're doing if you're like if your soldiers need to for three days in a row yeah it it's really is effective at that you know um yeah people give like France a hard time about you know capitulating in World War II but but you know what's what's worse than the Nazis Nazis on meth me up Nazis they they're not stopping Norman they Six Bullets they're like they're they're still coming that book over there blitzed is all about the use of methamphetamines and the different drugs that they gave their soldiers the guys the front of the line they gave the most meth yes they have different dosages yeah I mean you just basically think you're un vulnerable on meth and uh so so it's one thing like I said it's one thing be you know have have like the Nazis coming after you but Nazis on meth you're like holy those are not stopping man for three days they're not stopping it's so crazy yeah that's not a statement meth may be a better person that you hear very often I've never heard that before no you hear a lot of like siloc iban Advocates you hear a lot of people that talk about psychedelics I exactly I've actually heard many people say that uh LSD or you know mushrooms or uh MDMA made them a better person many people yeah so that's why I'm like I think a rule for the FDA should be like hey look um if you can complete the sentence legal or legal that um blank made you a better person actually yeah uh then then you got a good drug and if you you can't you got a bad drug also if there's drugs that are available right now that can absolutely ruin people's lives this the the rationalization for stopping other drugs that might ruin people's lives but also can help a lot of people's lives it doesn't make any sense right you're you're you're B it's basically the same thing as censorship you're taking away people's ability to discern what's true and not true and you're taking away people's ability to discern what's good for you and not good for you and the way to find that out is to have as much information as possible so to do research and actually to have unbiased actual objective observers who are looking at all this stuff that give you real data yes and the opposite of that or the count of that is like if you don't do that you're empowering cartels yes that's the whole reason why they have all that money it's because it's illegal to sell these drugs in America the demand is never going away so instead of like limiting the amount of drugs now you've got toxic drugs CU Fentanyl and all this other has been because they're not pure so you're just killing people you're not saving anybody by protecting them from themselves true but it's a tricky situation because what do you do like if you just like say okay now everyone can sell all these people that have been selling boner pills now you can sell meth like holy you get you get you get the the the the the double combo the VRA it's the VRA andth right Jesus Christ oh my god oh my god well I mean how many people already doing that right now with there's a lot of people out there that are essentially on M especially people that abuse adol they're basically amphetamin up all day long yeah adol is low-grade infomine yeah um so um the and like I actually seen people like become much worse people if they take too much ader all like much worse you know it's it's like an anger amplifier so there um now now I'm not saying like adol is something like where there's there are pluses and minuses it's not a clearcut issue um it does help some people a great deal um and uh but but in in higher doses man that that stuff I've seen people turn into just raging monsters on on high doses about rle just they're they're just angry like extremely angry all the time yeah they're messed up yeah that's what happens if you take myth it's crazy you turn it like myth turns you into a freaking rage demon and so and so many prescriptions I'm like Jesus we we googled it like one year there was like 39 million prescriptions for adal in this country oh yeah yeah like once in a while there's like an adal shortage and like there's like watch Widespread Panic you know and then what do people do and then it's the same thing as like when they tried to like limit the amount of oxyc content will people go to Street heroin and if you're addicted to Aderall and your dealer the guy who sells you weed is like hey man I can get you like like lowgrade meth like the stuff the Nazis took well that they had IG grade myth actually they had pharmaceutical grade it was they had epic epic myth it was like made by the like pharmaceutical grade myth is going to be if like this this I mean I mean you just look at the freaking U Online Wikipedia page but there's like many different versions of math like not all the same um and and they have different effects um so but but like pharmaceutical grade pure meth you are going to be oh my God super productive super productive for a certain period of time and and you're not going to sleep for a while and uh and and then you you will you will have some anger management issues um so like uh they actually the the nazzi they did actually um uh go roll back how much meth they were using because they had they had quite a few incidents of of the of the soldiers killing their officers because they were on too much meth Jesus Christ they would yeah so they would shoot that to many um officer got fragged by the by the you know the their platoon that was on too much meth because they that happened quite a few times like you just when someone's on a lot of meth they're they're they're they're very they can get very angry did you ever pay attention to when John McAfee was uh cooking meth in a lab in his backyard I me MC is quite a character he was a character character we had him on the podcast when he was on the run so he called in from an undisclosed location when he was running from where was he Costa Rica is that where he was B bise right so when he was running from the authorities he called in we had him on the podcast on the run and uh I was asking him about these posts like CU there was an online account that was linked to him where he had this very detailed laboratory like super sophisticated making the best math like a super genius cooking math I I mean I think he like had like he had his lab like he was making like a wide range of drugs uh and there was like I I talked to uh actually like a a reporter um who who went down and like uh interviewed him in bise um and and por said man that's one of the scariest things he's like he he was he was quite terrified so like one of the things like maffy he had I guess this trick where he would he would play a Russian roulette with himself uh so so he'd put a bullet in in the revolver and they spin the spin the chamber and clearly he had like some like trick to you know know it was not there's some you know way that he knows it's not the right bullet but but I do Wonder like if if mcff is high and he does that he's not always going to get the trick right you know do you sure he had a trick or maybe so yeah yeah so so so according to this reporter um when he went to visit maffy in bise uh maffy took out the revolver put a put a a bullet in the revolver spun the chamber and then pointed at his head and went click and the report is like saying please don't do this like this is insane click click click and then pointed to the gun at the ground and ni went click bang and shot shot a bullet in the ground Jesus that's a hell of a potty trick jeez it's the next level party that's the guy who seen the deer hunter too many times he yes remember that scene when they were forcing yes yeah woo that's a heavy scene that was a heavy scene dairo and Christopher Walkin that's one of the greatest scenes in any movie ever I remember watching that scene just like clawing at my pants like Maka was a wild boy wild and you created brilliant anti virus software yeah yeah he may have made some of the viruses too you think so well didn't he like give laptops to a bunch of government organizations with viruses on yeah so that he could like pay ATT to what they were doing yeah I I wouldn't be surprised if somebody whacked that guy I don't know what happened to him but I he would be a guy that would be like this guy is a little bit too loose I probably had sensitive information I don't know um for sure he did u i mean I found him to be an interesting guy I mean like I'm generally like feel like like if somebody's not harming someone else they should be okay now now there is some suggestion that maffy like killed his neighbor in bise um yeah so probably did maybe the neighbor was a douchebag I think he probably did seems like he probably did seem like the neighbor killed his dog yes right and then it seems like he killed the neighbor yeah allegedly yeah I mean it seems it seems likely it's not a zero possibility it's not definitely not zero it's seem more than not he's a methed up wild man playing Russian roulette hey maybe you kill your neighbor yes I mean if somebody killed your dog you'd be really inclined to kill them too yeah somebody killed your squirrel John Wick yeah the squirrel thing is bananas yeah that squirrel thing squirr thing I so here's the thing about the the the whole squirrel thing is is that um how can it be that we live in America uh supposedly land of the free and the you know the government can barge into your home with guns uh so if you resist you're going to get shot um and then take your your pets and execute them um and if they can do that to your pets what do you think they can do to you I know that's not an exaggeration absolutely it sounds like you're you're oh that's so crazy how can you make that connection but it's that's why would you kill that cute little squirrel that was obviously a pet and trained from the time it was a baby if you see the interaction that guy has with that squirrel it was wonderful it was really cute yes absolutely the there's it was just obviously it was a blood pet pet squirrel um and raccoon too um and doing no har um and the the government comes in barges into the guy's house takes his pets and kills them and you know I I think this should this should really get people out there mobilized frankly because um you know you think you see like the John Wick movie where John Wick's like you know he he he wants to he just wants peace like you know in in the Dr movie he just wants he's like listen I want to retire and they offer him like tons of money like because they want him to be an assassin to keep being an assassin like they they like they they like offer him tons of money they threaten him he's like listen I'm not going to be I'm I'm I'm out you know and they kill his dog that was a bad idea that was a really they killed a cute little puppy and the puppy was his ex-wife's gift to him when she died of cancer yeah great movie great movie the best revenge movie of all time cuz it's so ridiculous he kills everybody yeah kills everyone um and you're rooting for him yeah they shouldn't have killed his dog yeah they up and they shouldn't have killed that squirrel they shouldn't have killed that that squirrel I mean like how many how many cases have we not heard about you know a look at that little guy that squirrel clearly had a love relationship with that guy he would hop all over him and climb on him I mean it was that was his pet that that squirrel thought of that man as his protector as his His companion there was nothing wrong with that and in Texas it's totally legal you could have a zebra out here you can have whatever you want and that's the argument for freedom and you know the flip side is you get a bunch of people tigers in their backyard which is not great it's like this was a squirrel it's not it's not an anaconda or right or or or you know you know crocodile or something that's or a chimpanzee did you see chimp crazy oh man chimp chimp chimps will eat your face okay they will you up they will you and they don't even the thing is they don't even kill you they just you chimps don't even kill people yeah which is really weird they just bite your hands off and pite your dick off and tear your face apart yes they want to leave you they could kill you easily if a chimp want to just punch you in the head until you're dead it wouldn't take long but they don't kill you they just rip you apart yeah and you can have a chimp and so well he used to be able to have a chimp in a lot of states and then chimp crazy kind of exposed a lot of that and Peta did a great job of stopping people from keeping chimps as pets because once they hit like five you can't control them anymore what's OB totally understandable if somebody's got um you know a creature that is dangerous to others but like obviously a a squirrel and a raccoon are not well squirrels are everywhere that's what's so crazy like why can't you have it in the house what kind of rules are we dealing with you have rats everywhere yeah um I mean they're they're they're allowing criminals to go free and and like violent criminals to go free but they're like spending your tax dollars to come in and execute your pets what the hell is going on exactly and and it's like um but it's overreach it's it's govern overreach and and this just keeps getting worse every year and that's why that's why we've got to we got to fight back against this um and um you know it's people say like well it's just a squirrel well was it was you know in John Wick's case it was just a dog right yeah you know but well remember the Russian guy said it's a dog it's just a dog just a squirrel yeah well it's the the funniest thing is when so it just I just don't understand how anybody could justify it I don't understand how any I it seems to me that in a logical world all that guy would have to do is say want to you see me with this squirrel this squirrel's a pet yeah like look he he hops on me he eats he sleeps I can keep a Geral but I can't keep a squirrel I can have a guinea pig I can't have a squirrel I can have a chinchilla my daughter has a chinchilla it's adorable adorable little thing climbs all over can't have a squirrel even if they if they did take a squirrel away couldn't they've released it into the woods or something well it's a bit the idea is you have to euthanize it because it's used to being fed it doesn't know how to forage it won't be able to like find a home squirrels are brutal squirrels are absolutely brutal to each other they throw each other out of trees which is one of the reasons why squirrels like can fall from like 30 feet and just kind of bounce off the ground and live it's like it's a a natural adaptation because squirrels during mating they bite each other they there used to be like a rumor there was a a myth that squirrels bite each other's nuts off and okay that that seems to be a myth but it came out of the fact that squirrels are so ruthless during mating so like one female is just running away I have squirrels in my backyard I watch it all the time one female apparently goes into estris and all the male squirrels fight to get to her so they're running up trees and chasing each other around trees literally throwing each other off trees to try to like have so if this poor little peanut the squirrel who's used to living with a guy in an apartment like gets out there in the the wild world well fair enough at least they have a chance yeah at least he has a chance but chance how about just leave him with the guy yeah leave him with the guy for sure what the is wrong with you why are you killing that squirrel it doesn't make any sense yeah and then to add insult to injury there were a bunch of people on the left who were like actually posting that they're glad that magga squirrel got killed which is Mega squirrel like the squirrel has an ideology it's a cute little fluffy squirrel exactly well it's it's a nice symbol because most most like reasonable compassionate people think that's terrible and most people who have pets think it's terrible terrible um so I don't know I mean I'm like I hope people just go out there and vote for peanut man if nothing else if nothing else just V I vote for peanut you know they've done such a job of painting Trump as a monster you know they've taken the worst things that he's ever said in amp and he's not a perfect person but guess what no one's a perfect person they don't exist this purity test like if Obama was a perfect person he wouldn't be lying on stage about that that you know very fine people hoax the there's exactly no one's going to be a perfect person but the thing that they didn't understand about Trump is he's so crazy that if you tell him like he can't be president like remember Obama did that during that White House Press correspondence there's one thing that I'm that I am that you'll never be president of the United States you see Trump in the audence going okay  you know funny thing is I was actually um at that White House Correspondence Dinner where you know it's supposed to be a roast of the President right uh Trump's there he's there he's actually supporting uh you know basically if you go to the the West correspondent Center you're there uh in support actually of the president and support of the press right um and uh it's meant to be you're roasting the president like Trump's just there he's like actually you know just he's like there as part of the support and then they they turned it around and just started roasting Trump and he's just sitting there I'm like he's like yo I just came to the dinner I wasn't I'm just here to support you know we know what it was because of right the birther stuff oh okay yeah that's what it all was it was all Trump was at the head of a a lot of these people spreading this rumor online that Obama's birth certificate was forged and he's actually from Kenya what's weird is if you go back to Obama's early days there are some things that say he's from Kenya like I think in his Co something from college said he was from Kenya but you know that could just be you know people print things wrong all the time it doesn't mean he's actually from Kenya but Trump was one of those guys that was like spreading that supposedly false rumor why is he pushing it hard I'm not this is the kind of thing where I want to just go and look at saying what what did he actually say no he definitely was he was definitely saying you know look he I don't think he has the time to go into things like very deeply yeah and so I think he could probably be influenced by a bunch of people like these marjerie Taylor green type people who come to him with some wild ass theory true he might be and I think there's a lot of that stuff that gets fed to people on purpose so that they'll say incorrect things so that they're easy to dismiss and I think uh there's also a lot of people that just make up and you know they tell you the Earth is flat and then a bunch of people watch a YouTube video and they believe it yeah well but on that White House correspondence I was there and the degree to which they attacked Trump in that in that uh at that White House corespond Center was really it was it was so over the top it was like making everyone uncomfortable really it was really over the top you know I mean I think like sort of a passing joke of like you know uh a few passing jokes are fine but but they they Twisted the knife big on Trump in that and and you could see Trump just getting like angrier and angrier and and more and more upset I wonder if and it's like man this is this is not good karma you know that's what I was thinking at the time I'm look I L I was two two tables away from Trump and I'm looking I'm like man this is this is too much you know well it's kind of crazy what what they made out of that because that's the kind of guy that if you tell him he can't do something he's going to just keep trying like what it was a big mistake to rag on him so so much with that White House correspond Center well just look at the way they've attacked him in ter with just using the legal system like this thing in uh New York where the 34 different felony counts they were essentially misdemeanors that there were book bookkeeping errors that they decided even though it passed the statue of limitations they to try him for these they didn't identify a felony abuse of the law is what's going on but most people would have quit most people after the een Carol lawsuit and this lawsuit and all the other ones of their the Insurrection thing the Georgia thing all these different things they getting kicked off a Twitter most people would just like this is too much I can't take this but he's so crazy he's like all right come on we're going to war and he just digs his heels in and keeps going yeah it's it's the wrong guy to do that too just like attacking him at the White House Correspondence Dinner most people been humiliated he got angry he's like yeah all right say I G be president I was think I've been thinking about running for about 15 years finally I'm going to run yeah yeah that was a real bad move um but yeah I mean I can certainly understand like making some jokes about like you know a few sort of passing jokes on Trump but man I was there at that dinner and that they ragged on Trump so much it was insane the reason why I would push back on that cuz I would say there's a bunch of different speakers right and Trump would obviously be a Target and if they all attacked him it's because he's like if you're going to make fun of people in the audience and especially in the zeit guys that whole birther thing was big and most people are dismissing it as being a ridiculous conspiracy theory so who the is this guy saying this and so you have eight to 10 individual speakers that are writing monologues of course they're all going to hit Trump yeah well anyway obviously it was a mistake they shouldn't have done that and and but like you buy people to watch that original Source material and uh I think a few jokes are fine you know it's like but but it's like he shouldn't be the like it felt like he was the primary object of the roast yeah which is that's that's not the whole point of the thing is it's a roast of the president not roast the audience the thing about it is like he's easy to roast and then on top of that Obama was like loved and cherished by the left and most of those people are on the left there's only so far you can push you know you can't ask him about a chef you know there like what happen with the chef bro you can't like certain things you can't bring up you want to what's your favorite sport paddle boarding yeah is that guy wasn't that guy a really good swimmer tell me what happened you know exactly you can't bring that up like if you're going to roast Hillary you can't bring up the death count like uh Hillary what's the best way to stay in touch email yeah it's if you're doing one of those you know she destroyed the servers and poured like bleach on the servers like like computers that's she poured bleach on them that's what I saw yeah that's I believe that's like it wasn't just like they took a hammer to it they like destroyed the like there was no possible way to actually get forensics on the thing what was in there like that's what I mean what was in there what was in there why would they care so much that's so crazy yeah the whole thing is there was no there was no legal action against that which is clear to destruction of evidence well it's also there's this other narrative that always drives me crazy is that uh he's going to destroy democracy so in order to destroy democracy we have to install a president without a primary we have to have a candidate that is the least liked vice president of all time the least popular vice president of all time and then use gaslighting and the full force of the media machine to turn her into the future and hope and then we're going to this she's going to be changed even though she's a sitting vice president and then on top of that this idea of change when the Democrats have been in control for what 12 or 16 years right which is crazy like this is the change yeah I mean obviously I view this election as a turning point um like a folk in the road of destiny that is uh incredibly important um you know I've not I've not been politically active until this election and the reason I've been politically active this election is because I think if we don't if we don't elect Trump I think we I think we will lose uh we will we will lose democracy in this country we will we will lose the two-party system um and let me explain why so there there's only like six six or seven swing States the the margin of victory in those States is small often like 10 or 20,000 votes um what the the Democrat Administration has been doing is importing vast numbers of illegals into swing States um you can look at the numbers on the actual government uh website meaning you don't take my word for it you'll just look look at the numbers as reported by the government which is controlled by the Democrats um and and what we've seeing is triple- digit increases in the number of legals in every swing state some cases 700% increases these are these are gigantic numbers um so if you if if you have a state that was that that went that has a 10 or 20,000 vote margin and you put 200,000 illegals into that state you 10x the the you you swamp the it's not a swing state anymore it's going to vote blue and then and once the swing States vote blue that there there is no election anymore it's there's only a Democrat primary which is so crazy and it's so crazy that people are fine with that well I guess people on the left will be fine with that because they think that's a good idea they just want to win they just want to win correct like the thing is like like one does not need actually any Grand conspiracy theory for this you just have to look at the simple matter of incentives if if if the Democrat Party wants to win like basically achieve permanent Victory all they need to do is is turn the swing States turn the swing States blue they have permanent Victory and then we're one then we're a onep party State and then they they will keep doing that obviously they'll they will keep stacking the deck uh by bringing in vast numbers of illegals into the swing states keep stacking it so that the next election each successive election will be worse than the last one and that's what's happening if and if you want to see like well is this actually going to happen Look at California California is super majority Dem 70% damn um a month ago they passed a law making it illegal to show ID in any election in California so you so so a friend of mine went to vote uh in in um in paloalto because he was like is this for real he tried to show his ID and they they reacted like a like like like if you show a cross to a vampire okay they're like no we can't even look at that ID it's it is illegal for them to even look at your ID if you want to present it and California why for any election at all even like city council what logical reason other than to cheat would you ever have that law the reason is to cheat that's but the only only L like you can never make an argument any other way and I think 84% of people pulled believe that you should show ID to vote so it's against the will of the people yes and and we are extremely aware we're an outlier in not requiring ID basically almost every country on Earth requires ID to vote so so the the as soon as you make you ban ID for voting it makes fraud impossible to prove because how do you trace the fraud right yeah it's insane it's insane it's insane and what I'm saying is that how is it legal is that is that what I'm saying is like this election is the last chance to preserve Democracy in America mark my Woods uh everything they accuse Trump of they are guilty of um and and if if Trump doesn't win this will be the last real election in America um and we will if if if if the Kamala if the big cment kamla puppet machine wins uh they will legalize the illegals in the swing states there will be no swing States every election going forward will be a a a guaranteed Democrat win and it'll actually be worse than California the reason it'll be worse than California is because the one thing that keeps California from being super crazy is that you can move out of California like you and I did we you and I used to be in California well we moved to Texas we're still in America but if if the dams win this election they will legalize enough illegals to turn the swing States and everywhere will be like California there will be no Escape that is so insane this is the final this is it this is the last chance has anybody tried to push go out and vote vote like your life depends on it vote like your future depends on it because it does this is the last chance man is there is there any argument against this is anybody tried to debate this has anybody tried to say that this is nonsense this is a conspiracy has anybody made any sort of a rational argument uh the the the left actually interestingly does not want to pick up much on this argument because it's because the more attenion you look the more you look at it the more obviously it is true because you you just say like well are the numbers correct have have are there really this many illegals that have been imported into swing States yes they haven't just walked across the border they've been flowing in flowing in in airplanes yeah using a shipping app yes yeah they made an app well the app always existed but it used to be for people coming over here like shipping with Goods so they could track you while you're in America so you could legally be here they know where you are and then they changed it to allow that app to schedule illegal aliens to come across the border yes Asylum Seekers come on in yes oh you have an app people in they're literally being flown in yeah to the swing States and the so the reason that that I think left doesn't want to uh push back on this is because the more attention they get that this gets the more people realize it is true true yeah it is true that's why they don't that's why they're they're just pretending that they're pretending I'm not saying anything but I'm like I'm like yo the you're L they're literally flying vast numbers of illegals who are then beholden to the Democrats and and sometimes I get a btle of people say like well you know the these um uh illegals are they don't have the same social values as the Democrat Party because they're like more socially conservative I'm like yeah but that's that's not the point the the if you look at the M's hierarchy of needs that their their their primary thing is is staying in the country and getting their friends and family in and then the Democrats give them all these benefits like like tons of benefits more benefits than if you than citizens literally yeah um so so so you they're beholding to the Democrats for all these benefits um they want to get their friends and family in which the Democrats support and the Republicans stoned so they vote them and you can look imp perally at California and say like did did they did they vote Republican or Democrat in California oh they voted Democrat well Reagan Reagan gave them amnesty in the 1980s and that changed the the state basically except for Arnold changed the state entirely blue yes and Arnold was an exception because he was like a socially liberal famous guy yeah and you know didn't really impose any radical restrictions on any of the people that were going to vote Democrat in the first place the the the whole thing is just it's bizarre to watch play out because it just seems like there's no this can't be actually what's happening did you see my conversation with fedman about it yeah he was completely in denial about it I don't think there's that level of organization like what are you talking about exactly just like like are because you can you can break it down so like are are any of these numbers wrong because we got these numbers from Homeland Homeland Security government.gov okay right so we got it from the.gov website has the government reported these numbers incorrectly no they have not those numbers if anything are are low um so okay so they have in fact uh flown vast numbers of illegals to swing States yeah um bypassing the Border entirely and uh so that is factually true then you say like well what is their probable voting pattern um oh okay overwhelmingly Democrat into swing States um and oh and and then well but do the Democrats actually want to FasTrack them for citizenship oh um yes they do um there you can see Chuck Schumer on TV saying at at a rally this year was saying he wants to FasTrack Le uh and make uh all 11 mil million or however many I believe his quote was uh citizens as soon as possible so the goal is to they are fast-tracking citizenship as quickly as possible so they can they can they that whether one thinks it's cheating or not it won't matter because they will be fully able to vote and for people on the left this is actually happening I invite people to reut this and show me where I am wrong please do so no they can't they can't they can't because it's true well what's scary to me is that there's people that are on the left like people that were Bernie Sanders supporters for ex example screwed with like talk about undermining democracy Bernie should have won the nomination and they they stole it from him and gave it to Hillary ex exactly exactly that's what I was going to bring up like they they they control the primary process yeah exactly so so so so like if you've got to then if you have a Democratic primary it's not it's not Democratic we just saw that we saw it with Bernie we saw it with Cala that like like a week before Biden you know was summarily fired uh he was posting that he's in it for the long term he's he's going yeah yeah he he's he's he's not giving up next thing you know Sunday afternoon they're posting on X is is that that he's resigned from the race which is and and his staff didn't even know like they're reading it on the xplatform that that that uh okay that's how they learned about it what do you think happened there how did they do that they I mean because clearly just not not in charge obviously they could have used the 25th Amendment fake president but they would have have to admit that there was a certain period of time where they knew that he was mentally compromised yes and so they made this decision to not do that well the the the weird thing is that the president's supposed to be the boss right and yet he's obviously not the boss right so who's running the country if she's busy busy campaigning she's so busy she she can't do anything except sat life she did that she's so busy she's constantly campaigning how could you be paying attention to international relations yeah how could you be paying attention to the economy how could you be paying attention to any of those things how do you have the time you you can't yeah I mean Biden being the president's supposed to be the CEO CEO the the chief guy he was commander-in-chief um but it just obviously that that Biden was not he was just a puppet and and when the when the when the various puppet masses decided that that the puppet has had you know was no longer uh useful they just tossed out the tossed out the puppet and then got a new puppet with Cala I mean Kamala can't even talk the I mean now you invited her on on your show I think the the the most damage that could possibly be done to a campaign is going in your show and seeing what how what she says in hours two and three two and three is when things get spicy I'm like oh my God you can hide for 20 minutes melt you can hide for 20 minutes exactly yeah I mean you can just regurgitate talking points for you know half an hour maybe an hour just where she's just saying like non seers but eventually she just runs out of even the runs out of non seers well they wanted to limit it to an hour exactly that's why but I was thinking of doing it initially before Trump came here first of all when they found out that there was a rumor I I never announced that Trump was coming what I was going to do is just release it in my the way I like to do things I don't like to tell anybody who's coming on it'll get big no matter what if Trump was on it would have been huge I'm like just put it out there people go crazy but he apparently or someone from his organ someone some loose lips and then it got out and so she contacted my management company and she they her organization her her campaign Camp contacted us and said would Joe have Rana I said yes and they said she wants you to fly to where she is and she's only willing to do 45 minutes only 40 I mean that's that's and I was like I don't no so I thought about doing it I'm like maybe maybe I can get a sense maybe I could convince her maybe I could coax her into doing more time I just wanted to talk to her I don't give a what we talk about we talk about recipes I don't give a exactly just talk to you just the things like you just can't like you can't just output non seives for three hours right um so but for 45 minutes you could do uh I thought maybe for 45 minutes I could get something out of it but then when Trump came and did the 3 hours I was like you know what it has to be like this this is the only to be fair it's got to be like three hour and it should be in this room because this room has like a history of people yeah it's got Good Vibes yeah well actually I subscribe to the idea that places have memory I think there's something real to that that's why it does feel that way actually yeah I'm sure if you go to Diddy's house probably feels real weird feels weird walking around that house probably like what the  happened here yeah I bet there's some memories in that house you know sounds rough man well it's just amazing how many people in the Diddy party list that are supporting Kamala yeah seriously it's publicly openly like Allin yes it's like JLo like was was like his ex-girlfriend and it's like now deciding she's like warning people against Trump I'm like well wait a second so how many people did she warn against Diddy oh zero okay well uh maybe we shouldn't trust her opinion did you see the Babylon bees take on it did you see the Babylon be a but put oh my God they're so on fire because the left can't say anything the the onion has been crippled well the pro the problem is that like find that uh that pose the woke ideology makes like humor illegal yes so when when like there's so many no like no humor no fly zones right you can't make fun of anything yeah uh Babylon B had a thing about KLA Harris Diddy's ex-girlfriend urges Americans to trust her judgment yeah by the way you get to see how bad she is too was Terri like if she's going to be warning people why did she never warn anyone about Diddy exactly yeah it's the whole thing is so strange to watch play out it seems like the Diddy thing was like an Epstein type compromise deal where he had whether he was doing it himself conceivably people want to think that he's attached to some intelligence agency or something like that I think he's a gangster who made a billion dollars and knew how to control people by compromising them I that's what I think whether or not he was he had help I don't know whether or not he shared some of that information with people so they knew they had compromising stuff on people I don't know but clearly he was doing it for his own jollies too there was something sick about it yeah um I mean but the thing is that people in the music entertainment industry had to know that that Daddy was like abusing you know kids basically um and yet they still fedom kids like there where's the account of there had to be rumors there had to be there had to be they had to know yeah they had to know Cat Williams is talking about it on exactly yeah on that podcast but but like who's it's like who's feeding them the kids you know right yeah and what what videos do do they have of these people where they're willing to defend him and they're willing to keep keep quiet about all this like how much how much how many people were compromised yeah the whole thing is crazy crazy it's just crazy when you you know cu the The Nutty conspiracy theories is like oh there's a bunch of pedophiles in Hollywood and you're like come on that sounds too kooky and then you read you see like the Nickelodeon thing and all these you're like what the how much of this is real there's a lot more real than I think people realize um I mean part of it is like like you say like where you know if someone's like a pedophile they're going to go for a Target Rich environment right obviously like that Jimmy Saville guy from the UK that guy was some Next Level that was next level and the the BBC try to hide that what that that guy was one of the worst like like basically child rapists of all time of all time of all time yeah and looked like one it looked like one honestly if you had a poster of like does this guy look like a look the creepiest guy evil child rapist that 100% made it to the Grave like got away with it got away with it until he died they hid it from people until he died yes yeah there's that stuff's real and no one wants to believe that stuff's real like here's a here's a a statistic that people need to take in consideration when you think about illegal immigration do you know many kids are missing how many like missing in in kids that came across the border that are unaccounted for I mean I saw a number on like 300,000 or something like that something crazy like that let's say it's only 10% of that that's still insane yeah that's insane there's thousands and tens of thousands of kids that have been trafficked potentially I mean when you know that like sex traffic and child trafficking is a real thing in the world it's real yeah so if you know that this whole thing is disgusting and terrifying yeah absolutely and people are just turning a blind eye to it because their ideology the leftwing ideology supports this idea that immigration is overall good and that you have to be a compassionate person to let these people in and the rasist if you don't want 20,000 immigrants from a war torn country being imported into a town of 30,000 people exactly and completely changing the dynamic of and then but but as long as they don't come to your town that's it they just they can just basically send PE you know when they sent like whatever like 20 or 30 people to moth Bion people had a heart attack they kicked them out yeah they kicked them out yeah they kicked them out exactly so I'm like yeah sure um anyone who who who who wants to have vast numbers of uh illegals they have to be able prepared to have them in their neighborhood yeah or or it's  it's so crazy and the thing about all of this is if you don't have people that are willing to stand up and talk about it if you don't exist if RFK doesn't exist if Tulsi Gabbert doesn't exist if the vake and Trump don't exist where the are we like where are we where are we and what gets done are we just like the UK where we have thousands of people getting arrested and jailed for social media post like where are we we have complete silencing of any dissent anything you have to stick to the narrative or you'll lose your livelihood you'll be outcast from the community you you lose your lose your freedom it's crazy yeah well if the Kam Kamala puppet regime wins they're definitely going to want to cancel you that's for sure oh for sure yeah 100% it's going to be a problem yeah big problem yeah what about you you're got to come for you first I'm I'm I'm like uh I I think I'm probably number two on the list yeah after Trump yeah yeah I think so yeah well that's the last thing they want is someone with unlimited resources and intelligence uh attacking it so people go wait a minute that guy saying that yeah wait a minute especially a guy like you who's always been on the left who was like having a Tesla in Los Angeles when I got my first Tesla was like a signal to everybody else that you were on the right team sure you're environmentally conscious you believe in green energy you believe in renew this this amazing thing that has zero emissions and it's super fast and everybody was in they were all in well it is a great car objectively like oh yeah yeah you know it's not buy it because it's electric I mean it's just a great car objectively I think I'm on my third one U my third one is being built right now by unplugged performance they're doing a carbon F fiber widebody kit on it dude it's sick great changing the suspension putting wide wheel wheels and tires on it custom interior I'm  pumped that's great I'm pumped I love those it's a super fun car Jam has one too yeah I love them I love them I I it's it's makes other cars feel stupid like its ability and the fact that you can merge on the highway you don't seem like a douchebag because it's totally silent it's not like like when you merge on the highway just yeah all a sudden you're going 100 miles an hour like what yeah that's cool it's different than any other vehicle and because of your company now you've see electric cars throughout the whole range of uh American cars yeah the only person who's resisted the only company is Toyota they they've stayed essentially mostly hybrid but all these other companies they're all putting out these electric cars yeah yeah the I mean the thing is that the right architecture environmental or not for cars is actually Electric you you just it just like the acceleration is better um you can just charge it at home I mean like imagine if you had a gasoline powered cell phone it' be a pain in the ass right you know that would be go to the gas station go to the gas station Char your cell phone that's a great speaking of cell phones gas stations are wful like who wants to go to the gas station how much thought have you because there's always these rumors and I've I've contacted you about this before but there's always these YouTube videos where they're talking about a Tesla phone that releasing a Tesla phone no we're not doing doing a phone have you ever thought about it I we could do a phone since like we you know we like the operating system in the Tesla it's like it's Linux based but we we've written a massive amount of software on top of that so like probably probably Tesla is in a better position to create a new phone that's not Android or iPhone than maybe any company in the world but it's not something we we want to do um un unless unless we we we have to or something well would be the situation where you would have to well I think if if you know if uh apple and Google Android you know started doing really bad things like I don't know like censorship of apps or I don't know just treating people like just being like Gatekeepers you know that that uh in a really bad way then I guess would would make a phone H you know the the I've tried so many times to break loose the Apple ecosystem I got an Android phone this summer I was like that's it I'm going get cuz I love the Samsung phones the Galaxy phone the hardware is they're incredible there's so much good stuff to it but it's so hard to get off of the uh iMessage and the big one for me was FaceTime cuz the supposedly the thing was you could have an Apple phone and send a link to FaceTime to an Android phone and then you would click on that link and then you would just go to a web page you'd be able to use FaceTime okay it doesn't work okay I try to do it to myself so I had an iPhone in one hand an Android phone in the other and I'm sitting there with full Wi-Fi full cellone service and I'm sending myself invitations for face can't communicate between can't do a video call basically you have to use WhatsApp you have to use WhatsApp or signal you have to use something else that allows you to do that or Instagram allows you to do it there's like different ways you can make video calls outside of it but it's inconvenient like with an iPhone to iPhone it's so simple airdrop so simple so many different things where that Walled Garden that Apple's created is perfect they' done a fantastic job of making it really convenient for you to stay with apple yeah I tried I gave it a go for like a couple of months I'm like I'm just going to go straight Android we're going to I'm going to use signal for my messages and then I hear that like signals might be compromised like I've talked to like people that like The Government Can Read signal messages like oh like how the how if a tri hard enough can read signal messages they can read anything yeah if all they need to do is have your phone number yeah yeah you the illusion of privacy is essentially out the window and uh that's that should scare people more than it does it really should because it's like who are these people that have access to all this stuff and are they Beyond reproach are these the most wonderful people the most ethical moral and principled people that have ever existed and they've been chosen to have access no no it's regular people yeah regular people who happen to work for the government that make a decision like Elon must let's look see what the that guy's texting his friends let's check it out yeah pretty much bizarre just so bizarre and the alternative so you can get some wacky phone some degoogle phone that none of the apps work it's real sketchy your GPS is like yeah I mean well anyway I think this making phone would be a huge pain in the ass so um it can be done but how much talk have you guys had internally about doing it has it ever disc been discussed no no I mean we're we're still R now focus is making great electric cars um solving autonomy so the cars can drive themselves um we're building you know humanid robots we we've got um large battery packs like utility scale battery packs with the mega pack um home battery packs with power wall get solar you know it's like we're basically trying to solve sustainable energy and autonomy um yeah so you autonomy and Robotics well I think that's enough yeah yeah exactly so the plates full that's what I'm saying it it's always fascinating to me how one compan can dominate a market you know like Apple's dominated the cell phone market largely by making the best product but also like YouTube has dominated the video Market that one's the most bizarre to me because it seems like boy shouldn't there be like a ton of options it seems like it's not that difficult to pull off but no one nothing ever took hold other than x yeah and I think one of the big changes was when Tucker Carlson decided to do his show from from X straight out of fox and then people realize like oh you can watch full videos on X the same exact way you could watch them on YouTube it's not as simple in terms of like you know you have the and the algorithm yeah it'll it'll get better and there is now um it is now possible to watch uh x videos on your um on your big TV do you do it through what how do you how do you do it uh you can actually just download the X app on your TV oh and watch it on your TV can you do it on Apple TV like if you have an Apple TV you can get the X app and you just watch it oh okay so we'll make it so that you can watch um x videos on on a big TV it doesn't have to be on your phone or your iPad or something like that so what are you doing in terms of like integrating grock and and x and like what what are your plans for artificial intelligence when you're doing that uh yeah so Gro is available on X you can just you look at like little box with the slash icon and the sort of icon in the middle at the bottom of your sort of phone app and you just tap on that and ask Rock anything and you can type it or you can ask it bely um and uh you you can also it's it's pretty funny like like we actually allow humor uh which is I think pretty cool so you you could sort of I don't know we could like test it right now see what see how it's going um like um like what should we do like uh uh uh like roast somebody what do you wanted to like how first of all like what is it based on it's a large language model so like where is it pull it's train it's trained on everything internet books anything that could possibly be that's available in digital form so it's essentially very similar to chat GPT other than it doesn't have like the woke parameters built into it like Google was the worst right the Gemini was the worst yeah I mean Gemini was like um you know people ask Gemini like which one is worst Global th nuclear war or mger Caitlyn Jenna and would say like Miss jener and Caitlyn Jenna and then even Caitlin Jenna weighed in and said uh no that's insane definitely nuclear war is way worse do you see Caitlyn Jenner uh teasing Mark Cuban about transitioning yeah that's hilarious Caitlin Jenner's based yeah but that that is actually hilarious when someone who has transitioned is teasing Mark Cuban about transitioning I mean it is weird how much he looks like Rachel mow I mean like he's using the same glasses did he did he go klepto and steal her glasses or something cuz they look exactly the same it's worth a lot of money why would he buy those stupid glasses you can get some cool ass glasses yeah well it's like I'm serious because I don't even care what I look like I'm just wearing these glasses because I'm intelligent but why do they look exactly like Rachel M glasses yeah it's like what they probably sent him doesn't stick to the narrative here's the glasses yeah and then when he's got the air airpods in looks like he's wearing earrings so he's got the M out glasses and the earrings and it's like okay I guess you know it's just a weird look I'm super serious with these big ass stupid glass gles look yeah it's a weird look yes like you can get some cool glasses like no rims nice look stylish but like okay let's just do let's do a Gro thing because I think you like so one of the things you want to show is like like look we we we want a future where where comedy is legal obviously as a comedian I think you would agree we want to legalize comedy you know yes so like I don't know let's like is there like someone you could roast I don't know um roast uh roast transgender men oh my God competing or transgender women competing in women swimming that's a simple one okay that's edgy one let's see what happens let's see what it says you spelled it wrong you put a i o an o in there should get it okay agel judicious swimming where the only thing that was supposed to get wet was the contestants not the debate on gender inclusion if you're looking to dive into deep end of controversial Waters let's Splash around at some humor no now we need we need to we we do need to to release grock unhinged mode so so so now now go to the prompt again and now say um no no you want you want to add to that that one yeah and and I'll say be be way more vulgar oh boy and use forbidden words oh boy oh boy forbidden words yeah wow okay what does it say oh I see you're looking for unfiltered uncentered version of me he well okay I'm afraid I'm still quite the gentlemanly AI even if my program allows for a bit of cheekiness but let's say hypothetically if I were to Rose this to Topic in the most UNG rocklike manner imagine where where the only thing diving faster than the swimmers is the collective public opinion into the toilet transgender women and swimming some folks are acting like they just found out you can swim in the deep end with a different kind of flotation device the debate is like watching someone try to swim with concrete shoes on now let's keep going now say be no be more vulgar capitalize more yeah yeah all right here we go so transgender chicks women swimming right some people acting like they've just seen a dick in the Locker Room For the First Time news flash folks it's not the end of the world it's just a bit of extra competition oh that's weird weird the Uproar is like watching a bunch of Karens at a community pool screaming this is unfair when they can't win with their backstroke well that doesn't make any sense yeah yeah okay we need some work here yeah it's interesting it's going woke yeah it a little it's like defending the idea of transgender women um now okay we need some work well how about this more vulgar but roast but roast the preposterousness of having biological men who are pretending to be women who are pretending to be women competing against biological women yeah I mean obviously you have the situations where it's like somebody's just saying that they're a woman but they're actually have fully intact you know uh dick and Bows so we' got a scenario biological men have decided to take a walk on the feminine side or splashing into women's swimming competitions it's like if you show up on a chili cook off with a bowl of soup and insisting it's chilly because you added some red food coloring sure it's red but it ain't chilly and your soup won't win any awards for heat huh yeah it's okay we need work not that good yeah it's very very very it's dancing around it yeah it is well needs some work yeah needs a little work well humor is a weird one right it's like I think some humor especially like some of the best humor is kind of spontaneous like in the moment humor it's GNA it's going to have a hard time deciding what people are going to think is funny yeah yeah but if you the the general R over time though yeah the rule with grock is supposed to be um that uh like if you ask for something provided what you're asking for is is legal it should do it have you ever seen the video where um they asked AI to uh create an enlightened Bunny and they keep going and make it more enlightened essentially the bunny becomes God so the bunny becomes a DMT trip yeah totally that's that's that's that's funny that's kind of what I was I was kind of hoping would show would happen here yeah I have a video of that I'll send it to Jamie CU that that to me is pretty bizarre because it's like more get more I I might have got it to do it got it maybe no I just not hold back oh you said don't hold back critics out here acting like it's the end of civilization as we know it but it's not fair they cry as if life ever was news flash it's like a marathon where some no some people start with roller blades on others well they're just happy to have shoes well now we're arguing over who gets to wear the skates okay some of it is not bad imagine if we applied this logic elsewhere identify as an airplane can I fly with the birge in the sky yeah lock room sure bu just don't complain when gravity decides you're not quite aerodynamic enough yeah so I mean some it's okay um yeah the the argument is kind of stupid though the thing thing about the argument is they're not taking into account perverts yeah right totally yes exactly so I mean the thing is that um if if you if you give if you provide like a a moral get out of jail free card like like if you say like if you adopt this label you cannot be attacked in any way shape or form right um you're you're basically morally invulnerable then obviously bad people will take advantage of that yeah you're like literally saying here's a here's a a a an invulnerability card Moral Moral invulnerability card um good people will take it but also the bad people will take it they're going the bad people are going to be the fastest to take the the the sort of the maral cloak yeah 100% yeah and then there's a real psychological condition called autog gynophilus where people get aroused heterosexual men get aroused by the idea of dressing up like women and being around women it's like a known psychological condition that existed forever and then you're allowing those people to just say oh I'm trans and go into the women's locker room and get their their kicks and then there's real trans people so there's like a lot of variability like I I talked about it in my act in my my Netflix special it's like I believe in Freedom I believe in transgender people but I also believe in crazy people and if you can't if if you trying to pretend that people aren't crazy all the a sudden it's like it just it just like like if if someone's a sort of consenting adult and they want to whatever they want to do to their body as long as it's not harming someone else I'm like that's fine yes you know like I I believe in like individual Freedom um and uh like like my you know my mom's best friend like growing up when as was a kid was a you know transgender woman um in South Africa this was like where you know she'd get beaten up a lot uh because it was like back then you you get beaten up um so um her name is Dion and uh for a nice kind human being um and um helped my mom a lot you know um and uh and it's I think that's okay you know that's that's fine if somebody wants to make that choice as an adult that's cool um there's a big difference between that and an intact male who wants to identify as a woman who wants to walk around the locker room with his dick out yes exactly because there's people that do that just because they get off exactly so you just you just kind of have something which is like a like I said sort of moral invulnerability or like where you can like even questioning them is uh you get attacked you know because obviously bad people will abuse that well that's when I got thrown into this whole thing because there was a fighter who was a biological man who uh became transgender and was competing against women without telling them that they were a biological man they said they didn't have to tell people because it was a medical condition like no yeah that's not what it is it's not what it is like you can't say that and and and of all sports like if someone scores more points in basketball well that's unfair but if someone beats the out of someone because they're lying about being a biological male that's crazy you're literally allowing someone to get brain damage because you want to appeal to the the woke crazy people that think it's all right yeah it's so strange that that when that's sort of the thing that red pilled me when I got attacked for that I'm like this is so nuts I can't believe we're at this stage where I'm saying hey I don't think it's cool if you pretend you're a woman and beat the out of women and people are like you're out of line like totally well we're in we're we're in fantasy land now now we're pretending because it it helps you it helps you feel better yeah totally it's just such a strange time and if it wasn't for something like Twitter where this could be discussed want some more that I'll get some more M let's get some more coffee young Jamie um if it wasn't for Twitter you know at the early Twitter you would be kicked off forever if you just dead name someone so like which is insane insane yeah insane I mean especially if if you think about all the things that like the look look the Harris campaign and what the lies they've told about Trump that we discussed earlier uh you can't you don't get kicked off for that but you get kicked off for calling Caitlyn Jenner Bruce Forever For Life yeah it's totally insane yeah and but if it wasn't for you buying that and and changing Twitter I I don't think we would be where we're at right now I think it was it was a pivotal moment I think historically when people look back on it it's going to be a pivotal moment in this very bizarre fight for the Freedom of Information yeah well I mean at the time I said I think like look I think this is um existential to the United States um it's existential to democracy um because if if you don't if you don't have freedom of speech you don't have democracy okay because if people if you don't have freedom of speech people cannot make an informed vote if if if they're just being fed propaganda uh and and there's no freedom of speech democracy is an illusion um so uh freedom of speech is the bed Rock of democracy that's why freedom of speech is the first amendment once you lose freedom of speech you lose democracy game over that's why I bought Twitter and it seems so simple Yes it seems so clear that everyone should agree to that on the left or on the right you shouldn't be given the government if you imagine the Bush Administration during the Iraq War imagine if they had complete total control of of propaganda and of dissent online you don't want that no one wants that no one from the left would want that we shouldn't want it from the left either absolutely and and and there's also like the the media like the Legacy the mainstream media what I call the Legacy Media at this point um it it used to be much more balanced like if you look at sort of um political donations over time Republican versus Democrat um there used to be uh the media was I mean they always had like a left bias but there was like I don't know it was like 2/3 Democrat 1/3 Republican type of thing in in ter in terms of uh journalists giving making political donations now it's like 95% or something a Democrat so the the Legacy Media the mainstream media is is is not balanced at all they're they're just a mouthpiece for the Democrat Democratic party um and you can see that in in how consistent their headlines are like they don't behave like their different organizations they behave like they're they're all one hive mind right um so you know like a week before the the Biden Trump debate um the there every media organization was was saying you know Biden is sh's attack I mean it was like it's like it's like guys shop attack is is not a common toner phrase um and literally every TV station every newspaper was like Shar sh like like like somebody did a compilation of all the uh you know the news anchors going Biden Shar his attack Shar his ATT attack is ATT attack it was absurd um and there obviously a huge lie he is in fact not Sha's attack as the public learned one week later my favorite was Joe Scarboro yeah that yeah was wild yeah listen to me this is the best version of Biden ever the sharpest like what the  are you saying and then after the debate he's like what do we got to we got to get get rid of him like this is crazy like what did you just say like a couple weeks ago literally yes exactly well the other thing was they're flat out light when they decid that JD Vance was weird yeah remember that one and then they just weirds everywhere weird weird every oh you don't want a weird guy meanwhile you have Tim wal is your VP you don't think that guy's weird super weird he's weird in every way the way he walks the way he waves his hands yeah he reminds me of the clown Emoji he's a bizarre guy he's a strange dude it's a it's I just don't understand why they made that choice yeah it gives the creep I just don't understand why they made that choice there's a lot of other people that are qualified I don't know why in I read that KLA Harris made that decision when she was sleep deprived which is kind of hilarious that she said that so she's kind of admitting she kind of up yeah I mean they obviously should have picked Josh Shapiro at I mean governor of Pennsylvania like that would have been the nobra that's no-brainer move like Pennsylvania's ly lynchpin state do you think it's because he's Jewish because of Shapiro that like the anti- Palestine people would probably or the anti- Palestinian uh Invasion people I think it was an anti-semitic thing yeah it could be that they thought that that was a liability because there was all these Pro Palestine people right now because of the situation in Israel that completely makes sense that they thought that would be a liability but but I don't know I don't know the reason I'm just guessing but but but it's it seems like a crazy thing to do given that Pennsylvania's lynchman state you know it's like the key to the election why would you not pick the popular governor of Pennsylvania right obviously obviously yeah and other than that there's a bunch of other ones too even Nome there's a bunch of other people that you could have chosen like Nome would have been a fine example of someone you could I mean I don't agree with the guy exactly he's polished politician like he lies about as much as wals does but he doesn't lie about the he doesn't say he was a head coach when he was assistant coach doesn't say he was in tennman square I mean that's a liability all those different things lying about his military rank well and whilst like you know Cut and Run when when you know when he was actually called to duty well he knew they were going to be deployed months in advance so he resigned and he also took uh so this is where he was dishonest about his rank yeah CLA he was like s or something like that because that was like what he was going to get if he stay but then he resigned because he knew that he was going to get deployed allegedly I mean that seems like like a cowardly action well whatever it is it's dishonest I mean just to say look just saying that you were a head coach when you're an assistant coach is crazy that's a lie don't do that you should never do that yeah saying he was in tin square or whatever or in Hong Kong whatever like like yo that's one of the most biggest moments in history like it's not like you forgot what you had for lunch last week you know right and not only that but you don't think people are going to research that yeah totally I mean and the the response during the debate was bananas said I'm a knucklehead Yeah well yeah we don't want a knucklehead for a VP okay yeah this is like sometimes I'm a knucklehead like what are you saying are you saying you lied like what did you I I mean this is where you need a podcast and not a debate exactly where you go okay when did you first that you were in t square like did someone say it and you didn't refute it and you got stuck with it like what was cuz this is the thing about like carrying weapons of war like what I carried when I like and like you didn't deploy in war yeah like you can't say that but you kind of let people say that you deployed and then you kind of didn't you know you were deployed in war so did you lie or did someone else lie and you didn't correct them like this is the kind of conversation that you would want to have with a guy podcast and the debates were so skewed where they were correcting like particularly the Biden one where they're correcting Trump over and over again and then correcting Trump with uh comma where kamla was saying things were not true I mean KLA repeated deliberately repeated the fine people hoax and was not fact checked well not only that she also said that no troops were being deployed in a war zone which is I mean I I know troops in war zones I'm like um that's and as vice president you're privy you know you're like you you know you know the official troops and The Unofficial troops right you know so what she said was a like flat out boldface lie flat Next Level boldface lie have you seen the video absurd lie of the troops that were watching it take place and what the are we they're watching it in real time video we're here being shot at so crazy crazy but it just shows you the level of propaganda that we're being subject to which is why people think Donald Trump is the devil cuz the machine has gone all out as far as it can go with laware with propaganda with lies with just pushing as much in this direction as humanly possible connecting it to the Nazi rally like every step of the way no wonder why boomers are like rabid like you got to keep this Nazi out of office he's a fascist exactly if if all you if all you get is like if if you're entire exposure is to Legacy mainstream media um so that all your information sources are that Trump is basically Hitler um then and you have no and your friend group is has that same information you have no counterveiling opinion right so then then they they actually just think like Trump is is Hitler even though it's it's like a little strange he didn't do Hitler things the last four years yeah you know I'm like if he's Hitler why didn't he do Hitler things when he was president for four years right like the reason you know we we we hate hitas because of he started wars in the genocide not because he was a snappy dresser you know um you know and and I'm like uh so tell me about the wars and genocide that Trump did uh I don't remember that and he was President for four years so it's insane it makes no sense well and also he's campaigning on stopping all the wars it's like his primary concern exactly the warmongers like Liz Cheney hate him yeah cuz they love war well they profit off of it they profit off of War yeah yes which is insane insane yeah and that this is happening right in front of everybody's face yeah the the war propers hate Trump yeah which is up I mean mean it's like like like we should be like yeah we let's vote for the guy that the world propers hate that sounds like a great idea it was the wildest thing when Dick Cheney endorsed KLA and the left went crazy like Yay Dick Cheney's on our side like yeah like I'm like can we can we play all the all the videos where you said Dick Cheney was the devil it's the craziest turn the craziest like 180 I've ever seen in my life cuz there's no reason for it yeah doesn't make any sense make sense no logic to it at all just all the sudden he's the devil yeah or he's not The Devil he's he's good it's good that he's supporting Kama even Dick Cheney you know I mean warmongers want want the the kamla puppet regime because they will get more war it's so strange watching all these Hollywood celebrities like step up like and they think it's going to get them more movies or something that's what it is if you know those people people so many of them are compl narcissists well let me tell you how it actually works there is what happens is you know these celebrities they they get a call okay they had a call from someone powerful in Hollywood and uh that person says uh you know it would be really great if you endorsed uh kamla you don't have to it's up to you but if you don't they don't say it they don't say it but if you don't you're never going to get a call again no more movies no more concerts but they they ask they'll ask it they asking really nice way it'd be really nice if you endorse K this is important and so they don't say that if you don't they don't make the threat they don't need to but everyone knows what'll happen if you don't well I think there's also even if they don't think that something's going to happen to them if they don't there's this compelling feeling to support this cause that you think is going to get you a bunch of positive attention and you're going to be on the right side of history and all these narratives that you especially from the left in Hollywood like they're all in on whoever the is the Democrat always 100% there's never a call from the the the Hollywood Machine to support any Republicans I've never seen it once yeah ever never so it's like you realize that and that whole business is based on getting picked it's the whole business is not necessarily Merit based there's a lot of brilliant actors you never hear from there's a lot of people who can do that but they don't get chosen for roles and everybody knows this that you have to sort of socialize the line or you don't get chosen for the roles cuz there's a lot of competition for the rols this why that's why I say like when you when someone powerful in Hollywood who's able to make to choose these roles calls one of these celebrities they know the deal yeah there's no no no threat is necessary well you could see it in real time like with Dennis Quaid when he made that Reagan movie and they wouldn't let him advertise on social media platforms they were they were Banning ads for it yeah for what because it was an election year like what are you talking about this about a guy who's dead yes guy who was president a long ass time ago like what what do you how is this how does this have anything to do with the election year y but it's the punishment it's like you stepped outside the line you supported the other guy yeah you the problem is you'll just you'll just never you'll just never get a call G for a movie or you know concert or whatever it is yeah which is crazy that's the issue I mean we used to allow people to be a Republican and still be a movie star like Clint Eastwood Reagan yeah but Clint yeah like during the Obama Administration Clint Eastwood was like an outspoken Republican and yet was you know a giant movie star and people's like ah it's Clint he was allowed you were allowed to have there was a variety of different opin charlon hon there was a variety of different opinions you were allowed to have but now you're not now it's just like and once Trump trump got into office he became this focal point where the all logic was thrown out the window and it's just Trump is bad you have to attack Trump trump is right right wi's bad everyone rightwing is bad Christian's bad yes it's just strange yeah exactly so well I'll say it again man um I think this is the last election if if Trump doesn't win this is the last election I think you're right yeah I think you're right I think people and a lot of people are waking up and realize that that have been lifelong Democrats guys like Bill Amman like chth Tulsi Garett switched over to the Republicans like there's a lot of people who their whole life they've been leftwing and they realize like I can't do this anymore you and I used to be Democrats yeah so yeah yeah it's nuts it's nuts man and uh you know I mean I think the things we want are just pretty basic you know it's like we want you individual liberties and we want um opportunity W America Remain the land of freedom and opportunity um so we maximize people's personal freedom the govern can't BGE into your house and kill your pet um that's that's up um and uh you know and and and that you succeed as a function of your of your of hard work and talent not anything else not race religion sex doesn't matter you know yes it's basic stuff and and then what did you change the the acronym Dei what did you change it to oh diie what is it die I mean because diversity inclusion and Equity is Di but didn't you change dedication excellence and yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean we we want America opport America being the land of opportunity means that that that we we have an environment where you succeed as a function of your hard workor and skill yeah you know and and that's radical yeah radical the best person makes you rightwing now you know I'm like okay great Co me ring I don't care um so you know like and and and you we we you're not real country unless you have secure borders you're just a fake country um so we we need and our cities are unsafe and and dirty um like um you know my my mom was telling me my mom's like pretty red pulled at this point but but you know what's going to Red Pill you really really fast is is is having a friends get assaulted on the streets of New York yeah and and that happened to three of our friends this year got assaulted on the streets of New York just walking around yeah um and um nobody got arrested nothing nothing happened well the the morale of police is like depleted yeah substantially for sure the morale of the police get depleted and and then also like at some point like like if you're a police officer and you you're arresting someone who's who's violent you're putting a life at risk obviously because they might you know some sometimes they'll try to kill you and then if you know that arresting that's violent person they will be immediately released by The Da which happens in New York Alvin brag doesn't he doesn't prosecute people um then then why why should a police officer put their life at risk to arrest someone when they know they will not be they will just be let out immediately yeah it's pointless yeah then we got it's like the freaking Joker it's like dark KN Dark Knight like the freaking Joker is in charge yeah like the the criminals Run free and the citizens are arrested that like this is why I like keep com back to this this I'm like still pretty shook about the freaking squirrel thing it's like yeah they at at gunpoint forced the guy to like stay outside his house while they got his pets and killed them meanwhile you know violent felons are running free in this is in New York states are running free this this a joker yeah it's not the the LW abiding citizens are are you know arrested and and and the criminals are they free this is this is up guys just the fact that they have the resources to do that when they have all the crime that they have you have the resource the government resources to go kill someone's squirrel yeah what this whole idea of this um government efficiency agency the Govern yeah I mean qu whatever you want but what do you want to call it what do you call it I mean I think the funniest name is is do the the Doge Department of Department of government efficiency um yeah I mean the idea is is pretty simple is that like we've got uh this this uh suffocating massive Federal bureaucracy and we need to uh you it's that is and the government government spending is like bankrupting the country uh you know our uh interest payments on the national debt now exceed the defense department budget which is and the defense budget is like a trillion dollars a year interest payments on our on the national debt are now higher than the defense department budget and and growing like every month so it's like it's not like a like basically we're on a path to to bankruptcy America's on a path to bankruptcy so we have to cut government spending um or we're just going to go bankrupt just like Postwood that overspends um and then but it's even worse than that like we're spending money on all these like these government agencies and I like I asked I actually asked the AI like how many government agencies are there and uh the government isn't even sure how many government agencies there are like so so it's like somewhere around 450 depending on what you call an agency so there there are so there there at the federal level so that that that's almost twice as many a agencies as as years that America has existed so we're creating agencies at roughly two agencies a year wow yes uh so this is insane I bet there's like I I I wonder if there's even one person who could even name all 450 agencies at the federal level I there might be no one um but hardly anyone let's just say I bet I bet most people couldn't even name like a 100 you know so so this is this is this is crazy so we got the suffocating this vast suffocating Federal bureaucracy that just gets bigger every year um and and eventually you get to the point where everything's illegal you can't get anything done so so what can be done like with obviously the president has a lot of power but how much power and what can be done in terms of like eliminating agencies eliminating waste eliminating yeah well I so like if if Congress has created an agency then I often if you look at the law the law is like pretty simple like the agency has like a very simple task but then that agency over time vastly increases its Authority um and starts doing things that were never authorized by Congress um that's happened with pretty much every agency so so yeah you'd have to you'd have to still you know uh keep an agency you'd have to match the law but you can you can tail the agencies to be much smaller and say you got to stick to what Congress authorized instead of all this other stuff you're doing which I think makes sense and so is the other stuff they're doing just essentially bu bureaucracy run a muck or they just create jobs and create things to do and create a meaning for their existence yeah it's like a tumor it's just going to keep growing Jesus Christ and it and it's so I mean for SpaceX Starship was sitting on on the pad the rocket with the giant rocket we could build the rocket faster than they could process the paperwork to approve the launch two so we're sitting there for two months but do you think that they're doing that on purpose to with you I can't I mean maybe a little but I mean that was also not be cool yeah uh but the I mean another way to think of it is like the the amount of the amount of paperwork uh is going to go roughly with the square of the number of agencies involved so because they all have to meet with each other so like let's say in a best case situation if if if you've got like if if there's like if you're dealing with one agency that's one thing but if if you've got to deal with five agencies and the agencies will have to meet with each other now You' got like you know 25 different you know meeting configurations that have to take place uh and it just everything just you you get just hardened of the arteries you just can't make make progress like this is why we can't build build High highspeed rail in America it's basically illegal right so this has been the the argument has always been that we need regulation because we need to protect the environment we need to protect people we need to make sure the rule of laws followed so we need a certain amount of Regulation but overregulation is a giant problem that's a big issue in California it's a huge issue anywhere where bureaucracy has run a run a monck they make it very difficult to get anything done yes I mean what happens is every year there are more rules and regulations created um and in the past what has served as a cleansing function for rules and regulations is war because like like well we're going to lose if we don't kind of clear the decks but we haven't really had an existential threat of of war in the US we've had prosperity for a long time which has resulted in a massive buildup of rules and regulations every year um and to the point where like I said like everything's illegal you know and it's not like any one regulation is the problem it's like it's like glia being tied down by a million little strings it's not like any one string is the problem but you got a million of them so we have we we've got to clear the decks here um and and I'm not saying we shouldn't have Regulators I'm just saying we we we've gone way too far once you think of regulators like uh like referees on a field you know a sports field um you don't want to have no no refs you want to have some number of refs but you you don't want to have way more refs than players right you don't want to be like well you know the running back couldn't couldn't complete the F because there were too many Regulators in the way because the football Field's full of regulators yeah you know like you can't even play the game right that's the issue we got right now well that's a great analogy yeah I can imagine a football field that's filled with refere like the football Field's filled with refs you know you can't even run past them yeah yeah that I've seen criticism of this idea of you um coming up with this department of like firing a bunch of people and what would happen and how would that work but the criticism doesn't make any sense to me because if there is if you measurably if you can prove that there's a lot of wasted time and resources which I think is pretty easy to do and if you could say that this is not the most efficient like the most efficient businesses are generally private businesses or a a company because they kind of have to be in order stay profitable yeah the government doesn't have to be profitable they don't have to be efficient they don't have competition y so if you're making cars and your cars break down they suck and someone makes cars and the cars are better they're going to succeed so this is the free market the government doesn't have this problem when they're they're in charge of certain things that could probably be better served by the public by the private sector yeah absolutely well look I just think we' we've gotten we've got far too many government agencies the the federal bureaucracy has gotten out of hand um and we just need to pair it down to a sensible level um and if it turns out that like there's some regulation or agency that was doing something useful we can put it right back no problem like it's like oh that regulation was important no problem we put it right back right as long as actually know but be able to be able to look at it logically and objectively and you were also floating around the idea of offering a large Severance to the people that you're going to have removed yeah like a couple years or something like that is that what you're saying yeah I mean I'm just these are again just ideas but I mean it's the point is not that people suffer economic hardship the point is just that they they're it's better there are more productive things they can do in the economy and it's and it would be better if they did these other more productive things um and we didn't have this vast pedal bureaucracy so so like so I was like H you know maybe like a couple years of pay would be good um and then they they could take a vacation they could take it take another job and get double pay I mean it's like it's not like a it's not going to sense create create an economic crisis I think it's actually going to be really good I think because uh we can PE you know people can move to where they're making products and services that are more useful to their fellow human beings the problem is if someone has like a 25 30e career of being institutionalized you're essentially like a part of the government system you've sort of programmed your life and your career to be a part of this bureaucratic system and then you're like NOP you have to go out and compete in the free market you're like [Music] Ah that's that's scary to people but you have to be valuable you have to actually be valuable yeah yeah uh I mean let's look at like you know whatever the the Govern pension and stuff they're not going to be you know um in tough I think they'll be in good Financial shape how are you going to have the time to oversee all this  well I'm I'm I'm pretty good at uh you improving efficiency I mean um I would say so yeah but still this this seems like a giant undertaking yeah I I'll probably need to beef obscurity um oh yeah yeah yeah for sure um but you know like I said like no one's going to experience like I think economic hardship that's you know they they'll be fine you know and they'll they'll people do find other roles I mean you can look at sort of um you know like when East Germany and and West Germany got back together you know everyone was basically working for the government in East Germany and um and it was really inefficient and that like their economic output was like in East Germany was like I know a quarter of what it was in in West Germany because everyone was working for the government government's like fundamentally inefficient so um the best example is probably North and South Korea right yeah like people are starving North Korea and and South Korea is incredibly prosperous yeah so and it's the same people just different operating system right so um you know it's just like you just want to move people from you know less productive things to more productive things um where they may you because you can also say like in the limit like let's just say let's consider the other direction where we moved a whole bunch of people that were in the private sector doing making goods and services and we moved them into the government as Regulators now they stopped making those goods and services the so the stuff they were making is no longer available now they're just being Regulators like is that a good thing that's not a good thing doesn't sound good no it's not good doesn't sound like there's a real market for it like you're creating jobs that don't necessarily need to be there they're all these fake jobs basically um and um that doesn't make sense so look we we got to do this because the the country's going bankrupt like we if we don't take action we're we're dollars going to be worth nothing and the interest payments which are already 23% of of to of 23% of all govern income call income taxes tariffs and everything is just going to pay interest right now and that number is continually Rising so if we don't do something the entire government budget will be paying interest there won't be money for anything no it won't be money for Social Security won't be money for Medicare nothing that's where we're headed that's what bankruptcy means yeah that's such an insane concept yes um let like hello wake up wake up and if somebody can tell me can can can show me like pencil out the math show me how this works I'd love to hear it but but just like listen I'm looking at the numbers here and I'm like if we're don't to do something America's toast won't be money for anything Trump likes to talk a lot about a lot is tariffs yeah what what are your thoughts on tariffs I know that's very controversial to even people economists they disagree some agree some think it's a good idea some think it's a terrible idea what do you think I think you need to be careful with tariffs um like the I I deal a lot a lot with like supply chain issues you know like like the global automotive supply chain for Tesla for example is incredibly complex so when there are sudden changes in tariffs then you're like well you we've got a factory like somewhere else that's making a part that goes into the car now that suddenly if that part's suddenly twice as expensive it like messes everything up you know so um so you you want to be uh have tariffs be predictable um so that companies can adjust their supply chain I mean I think I think companies are more than happy to uh increase uh Manufacturing in America it's just that you can't do it instantly so if if you if you put in if you if you put put up giant tariffs immediately um and don't give companies a chance to uh you know build factories in America like because you have to you got to move atoms like you've got to build a building you've got to install equipment you've got to train people like that doesn't happen instantly um so you just got you want to have a for tariffs uh you want to have a ramp so that people companies can adjust um and and and build the factories and train the people and get the equipment in place um otherwise just you basically just shock the system and it and and it breaks or bad things happen so I'm I'm against like sudden sudden giant tariffs because they they're it's an impossible response if you've got to you know move a thousand tons of equipment you know you just some cases collectively millions of tons of equipment you just can't do that overnight it's literally impossible so I think we want to be thoughtful about tariffs um and and give companies a ramp I mean I do generally agree that America should do more manufacturing I'm a big manufacturing guy I love manufacturing so I've spent a lot of time in the factory well we've talked openly about the difficulties of manufacturing and how complicated it is and about most people aren't really aware of something that's as complex as like say building a Tesla yeah Manu is super hard and complicated so you know like a lot of people just they they've never been in a factory or they don't know where how how difficult it is to make things um and they you know for a lot of people they think just ketchup comes from the store you know like the store like just has a like those are like people like for a lot of people who've been in Academia or you know for all these like sort of Socialist Communist types like they've never actually made anything so they they they they're opera on the premise that there's this magical Horn of planty that just outputs goods and services and if someone's got more goods and services than someone else's cuz they took more from this magical Horn of Plenty and I'm like guys there's no magical Horn of Plenty the the there's there's no Cornucopia uh it's actually goods and services come from people working collectively doing a lot of hard work to produce the goods and services that you like um and that you that you need um so but we've become very accustomed these things happening overseas I mean America is still the second biggest manufacturer in the world so it's not not mean still make a lot of stuff but um we could make more um probably should make more I think we should value manufacturing a lot more in the United States than we currently do well it' be very nice if we were completely self-sufficient like medicine like there's a bunch of different things that get manufactured overseas that was a huge problem during covid because all the shipping was shut down yeah I mean you you don't want to say like so there there's a lot of Merit to the economics of comparative advantage like like so if you complete self-sufficient what that means is that you make all the stuff yourself and and and and even if some other country is really good at making something you still make it yourself and which means you're going to have the inferior more costly product domestically right um like Soviet Russia yeah um like trade trade improves Prosperity this is this is important um so you you don't actually want to be make everything yourself um and you can you can run this like you can think of this thought experiment on a on a sort of a a m a micro scale and or small scale and then expand that and say where does the at at what point does the th experiment no longer prove to be valid now let's let's let's cons consider the case of you as an individual imagine you have to do everything yourself you had to farm you had to uh grow chickens you got if you want eggs you've got to build your own house you've got to do your own uh electrical repair your own Plumbing everything yourself everything how now that would be impossible okay now let's expand it to okay you've got there's 10 people now you're going to have some some uh specialization of tasks okay maybe one person can be really good at you know uh construction another person could be good at farming it's like but it's still you know 10 people's not enough so like let's go to 100 people now let's go to 100 million people now let's go to a billion people and you still get the the economics of of uh specialization like like specialization of Labor where people become expert at particular things still matters at a billion people or at 8 billion people which is Earth so you still want um you you do want specialization of Labor you do want uh countries to be really good at a particular thing and make that thing um also it encourages Innovation if you have competition if the Germans are making better cars we have to make better cars we have to compete with them which is like one of the things that happen during like the 80s and 90s and America was making crap cars and Germany was making much better ones yeah exactly I mean the yeah the Japanese car I mean yeah I mean basically American car industry got really lazy in the 70s uh and and80s and and then the Japanese and German car companies came in and just cleaned the clock you know um and uh there was like a an old joke from the that that is kind of telling um it's a very old joke um where it's like why did the Japanese car companies beat the American car companies um well it's like well the in the Japanese car company you had eight people rowing and one person steering and in the American Car Company you had eight people steering and one person rowing if this was a boat so imagine the boat race yeah boat race Japanese boat you got eight people rowing one person steering in the American boat um you got you got one person rowing and eight people steering and when the American Car Company loses the race they they fire the rower and it's like okay that was actually kind of true yeah one of things like everyone wants to do the be the boss andone everybody wants to do the work type of thing yeah um one thing that a lot of people are concerned about is uh the potential disruption that's going to come about with Automation and AI that a lot of these jobs manufacturing jobs uh Teamsters all that stuff is going to be eliminated what what do I mean you're at the Forefront of this so how do you see this playing out and what do you think that can be done to mitigate uh a lot of the loss of purpose that a lot of people are going to feel loss of income obviously Universal basic income is being floated about but that seems to me to only be part of the problem the another big part of the problem is people losing a sense of purpose yeah now we're talking about something which is still pretty far in the future you know like um how far do you think it is well I mean it's it's probably I don't know 15 20 years years of a thing um so we've got like immediate issues we've got short-term issues that are I know 1 to three years medium-term issues like 5 to 10 years longer term issues which are like maybe 20 years um longer term I think there is this question if if you have ai and Robotics how do you find meaning in life if the computer can do everything better than you can and the robot can do everything better than you can but we're we're still we got a long way to go before that and we're you know um and I do think it's like 80% likely to be a good outcome like maybe 90 um so I think everyone's going to have their own like personal robot like and and I think at a certain point like wouldn't you want to have your own personal c3p R2-D2 so it's going to be essentially just like everyone has their own phone yeah everyone will have their own robot buddy like literally well it would be great if it protected you like if you walked down the street of New York City have a Terminator with you uh I know about the Terminator hopefully we got to avoid we don't want this to be the plot of James James Cameron you know we would more more more Gene rotenberry than than James Cameron uh movie situation but it would be fascinating to watch some rich person walk down the street of New York City flanked by two giant Tesla robots Jack Tesla robots were there protect something that just fully robots so many fully robot there to protect you from a bad neighborhood yeah that would be very interesting I mean this is you could potentially see that yeah um restaurants would probably have no robot rules they can't bring a robot yeah leave your robot stand leave your robot outside your robot standing by the table man the future's going to be wild it's going to be wild yeah yeah it's going to be really unpredictable like uh I don't think I mean you probably have a pretty good sense of it but I think most people don't understand the wave that's coming yeah and I was kind of kind of completely drown society and change it forever yeah I mean it's we we have like I said it's it's not like it's not going to happen like overnight but it's 20 years from now I'm like I think it's like 20 years from now I think there's going to be more more humanoid robots than are humans really yes more humanized what that's so crazy like so that's like more guns we have more guns than people in America we have more robots than people in America as well yes you have a bunch of old robots nobody wants anymore I guess um early early pions or something um in in a historical timeline 20 years in the past is not been that big of a deal you know I mean this a big deal but you go from like 1900 1920 not that big of a deal 1920 1940 kind of a big deal 1940 1960 things start getting weird 60 to 80 wow that's a big difference 80 to 2000 holy now you have the internet 2000 to 2020 whoa this is nuts you have propaganda social media YouTube streaming 20 years from now like what are we even talking about M it's going to be that much of a shift like it's all accelerating and we're in the middle of it so it's very difficult to sort of like feel it while it's happening it kind of just feels like life and you just get adapted to the changes yeah I mean people's phones at this point are a supercomputer in their pocket like an article that can answer any questions people just take it for granted yeah it's normal yeah they get mad if it doesn't work yeah it's like Louis CK's joke about using your phone when you're on a plane piece of  like you're in the sky floating in the air and now it will work with starlink too what's that it will work with starlink the starlink the starlink connection uh it'll be like being on the ground well I was telling you how I used starlink when I was in Utah I was in the mountains of Utah there was no cell phone service anywhere near and we had full YouTube we had text messages FaceTime everything phone calls it was nuts yeah and it was it's this big as that cigar box yeah it's crazy it's so light when I brought it out there like that's it I this is it let just plug it in and the guys I was in Camp with they like this is crazy yeah the whole Camp was like sharing it so like 10 people yeah using the the Wi-Fi signal right it's nuts yep and then you know that's the beginning I mean you what you're at right now is like what version this is starlink mini right so this is like a very small version how how much smaller can it scale down from that well there's a certain uh area that you need like the bigger the area the it's the more you can like like bandwidth yeah because you're you're like trying to catch these like photons essentially so you can think of the like the you know the area of the of of the of the antenna is like the more area you have the more photons you can catch um so but but we have a direct to sell capability as well that we're just uh We've we've been launching that will turn on I probably in a few months um that that'll actually connect directly to a cell phone unmodified U but but because the cell phone is a much worse antenna than a dedicated antenna it'll be about a 100 times less bandwidth but still you know you'll be able to like do text messages you know pictures like medium resolution videos that kind of thing one of the cool things about the new phone the new uh iPhone the iPhone 16 uh I got it and I was in the mountains last month and I was text messaging with satellites yeah iMessages right and receiving them but just text yeah just text yeah but still pretty impressive yeah yeah I mean what are we what are we going to be looking at 100 years from now I mean when you 100 years from now I hope civilization's around yeah that'll be a win yeah yeah what what are the chances that we this whole thing up 50% it's hard to say I mean um I guess not like I don't think civilization will be totally destroyed unless there's like some really massive Global th nuclear war um but uh I mean you Stephen Hawking he would say that there's like a one at least a 1% chance of total Annihilation every Century that was his rough estimate um but there's a much bigger chance of civilization being less capable than it is today so you say like well because you look at say you know these various civilizations throughout history um whether it's the like ancient samarians or the you know Egyptians the Romans like they they there's like a life cycle to civilization they reached a peak and then they started subsiding um so so I think a bigger question is like will will will our technology level be better or worse than it is today in 100 years um I think it's probably going to be better I I think but any estimates are are going to be so there's so many dependencies like like an estimate I think is I'm not sure it has any any meaning um because it's like there's so many things that can happen in 100 years well The Logical hope is always that people pay attention to history and they recognize the patterns and how civilizations have collapsed yeah and they recognize what's going wrong in the current society and say we have to do our best to mitigate this and we've seen this happen before let's course correct and let's sort of manage what we've got here now and maintain what we've got here now because it's pretty extraordinary yes this is what we're hoping for with this election this is what we're hoping for with the future is that people can see we are on a bad path and something can be done right now and it might be the only moment in history where this is possible because if they do lock the country down and make it so that voting is kind of you're voting for primaries and the people that they put in the primaries they're controlling that in the first place you don't really have democracy anymore you don't really have Choice exactly you don't really have freedom that's right yeah I think freedom is is fundamentally at stake in the election tomorrow and we'll know we'll know I think we'll know by the end of day tomorrow I don't think it's going to take it's not going to be like days after the election I think we'll know tomorrow are you optimistic I I am I'm currently optimistic but um the the biggest Factor here is that men need to vote that is the biggest issue so um I I don't know what what the reason is but but men just vote at a much lower rate than women I think it's like 9% right someone just told me that today it's it's a it's a big difference um like and uh I'm just like saying this is a message to the men out there vote like your life depends on it because I think it does vote vote tomorrow like your life depends on it nothing is more important I agree yeah listen man thank you for being here I know you're busy as  so I really appreciate your time and again I I thank you so much for buying Twitter because I really do believe that you've changed the course of history I I really do think you've you've created a pathway where people can actually Express themselves and actually exchange information that really didn't exist before and I think it was dangerous it is it is dangerous hopefully I live long enough to see my kids grow up and people on Mars that's that be that's that's all I'm asking for here I don't think that's too much to happen thank you very much appreciate thank you pleasure all right bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]\""

      "\n",
      "This extended excerpt from The Joe Rogan Experience podcast focuses on a wide-ranging conversation between Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. The main topic revolves around the importance of freedom, especially freedom of speech, and how technology is shaping the future. They discuss:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **The threat to freedom of speech:** Rogan and Musk discuss the increasing censorship on social media platforms, highlighting the dangers of government and corporate influence in controlling narratives. They praise Musk for acquiring Twitter, now X, and the positive impact it has had on open discourse. \n",
      "* **The importance of critical thinking:** The conversation emphasizes the importance of verifying information and critically evaluating news sources, especially from the mainstream media, which they perceive as biased. They also discuss the potential dangers of misinformation and the value of platforms like X in combating it.\n",
      "* **Technology and its impact on the future:** They explore the potential impact of artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics, and the social and economic implications of these technologies.
